The basic idea is to implement only the things that are absolutely necessary inside the kernel, and keep everything that can be outside the kernel.

Generally its believed that increased user-kernel mode and address space swithces are responsible for the low performance of microkernel. and the conventional IPC is the bottleneck in these kernels. The author believes that things like IPC can be implement way faster and that a conceptual analysis is needed to understand the true potential and bottlenecks of microkernels,

key microkernel properties : Independence, Integrity.


# Microkernel concepts
## Address Spaces : 
Grant, Map, Flush

This architecture, allows us to leave memory management and paging outside the micro kernel and only the grant, map and flush operations are retained inside the kernel.

## IO

IO is also implemented as address spaces thus the controlling rights to these io is also done by memory managers and pagers on top of the micro kernel.

## Threads and IPC

Threads are implemented in the kernel because the address space of a thread should not be corrupted. so every change made to a threads context should be done in the kernel.

IPC the sender will deice to whom he wants to send the message and its contents. the receiver will decide if its willing to take the information and also how to interpret it. hence this makes the basis of independence. Note that grant and map operations need IPC since there should be an agreement between granter and recipient.

## Interrupts

Hardware interrupts are implemented as IPC messages. hardware is run as threads and they send messages, the recieving thread will conclude if the message is ipc or not and do the action required. The micro kernel is not involved in device speciic interrupt handling, it doesnt know anything about the interrupt semantics.

## Unique Identifiers

the kernel must be able to supply uid for different processes, threads or communication channels for different identification purposes.

# 📝 Liedtke – Microkernel Paper Notes (Sections 0–4.1.2)

---

## 🌟 Abstract

* **Thesis**: Microkernels (µ-kernels) are often criticized as **inefficient** and **inflexible**, but this is due to *bad implementations* and *kernel overloading*, not the concept itself.
* **Paper’s Contribution**:

  * Defines essential **µ-kernel concepts** (minimal functionality).
  * Shows their **flexibility**.
  * Analyzes **performance bottlenecks** and demonstrates achievable efficiency.
  * Discusses **portability issues**.

---

## 1️⃣ Rationale

* **History**: µ-kernel systems existed before the term:

  * Brinch Hansen (1970), Wulf et al. (1974).
* **Basic Idea**: Minimize the kernel → implement everything possible in **user space servers**.

### 🔹 Software-Engineering Advantages

1. **Modularity** → enforced by a clear µ-kernel interface.
2. **Fault isolation** → servers crash like user processes, no system-wide failure.
3. **Flexibility** → multiple strategies/APIs can coexist.

### 🔹 Why µ-Kernels Faced Criticism

* Most existing µ-kernels underperformed.
* Inefficiency limited actual flexibility (e.g., paging/file systems too slow at user level).
* Some systems reintegrated services back into kernel to regain speed → “hybrid kernels.”
* Folklore blamed **mode/address space switches**.

### 🔹 Reality Check

* IPC performance disproves folklore:

  * L3 IPC: **22× faster** than Mach (on 486).
  * Exokernel RPC: **30× faster** than Mach RPC (on R2000).
* **Conclusion**: Inefficiency is due to **design/implementation**, not the µ-kernel idea.

---

## 2️⃣ Some µ-Kernel Concepts

**Principle**: A concept should exist in µ-kernel *only if* moving it outside would break fundamental functionality.

* Assumptions:

  * Page-based virtual memory hardware.
  * System must support protection (untrusted apps).
* Two key principles:

  1. **Independence** → subsystem S cannot be disturbed by others.
  2. **Integrity** → communication channels must be secure (uncorrupted, private).

---

### 2.1 📦 Address Spaces

* **HW View**: Mapping virtual → physical pages (TLB + page tables).
* **µ-Kernel View**: Minimal operations while allowing arbitrary protection schemes.

#### 🔑 Operations:

1. **Grant** → transfer ownership of a page to another space (removed from granter).
2. **Map** → share a page across spaces (both retain access).
3. **Flush** → revoke access from others (safe, since only owner can flush its own pages).

#### 🔹 Reasoning

* Paging & memory management remain **outside kernel**.
* Only **grant, map, flush** must be inside.
* **Grant** helps pass mappings through a controller subsystem without bloating its address space.

#### 🔹 Extensions

* Access rights can be transferred with mapping/granting (can restrict, not widen).
* Device I/O handled as part of address space abstraction (memory-mapped I/O).

---

### 2.2 🧵 Threads & IPC

* **Thread**: Execution activity inside an address space (regs + IP + SP + state).
* µ-Kernel must control **thread → address space binding** (to protect memory).
* **IPC**: Fundamental communication mechanism.

  * Message passing between threads (secure, explicit agreement).
  * RPC & thread migration built on IPC.
  * Grant/map ops require IPC for agreement.

#### 🔹 Special Cases

* **Supervised IPC** → concepts like *Clans* allow user servers to monitor communication (cost ≈ 2 cycles overhead).
* **Interrupts as Messages** → hardware modeled as threads sending IPC messages to drivers.

  * Kernel transforms interrupts → IPC.
  * Device-specific handling stays in user-level drivers.

---

### 2.3 🆔 Unique Identifiers

* µ-Kernel must provide **unique IDs** (threads, tasks, or channels).
* Needed for reliable addressing & authentication in IPC.
* Must be unique in space and time.
* Cryptographic solutions too expensive for local comm; kernel-provided uids are trusted.

---

## 3️⃣ Flexibility

* µ-Kernel minimal concepts allow many OS services to be implemented **in user space**:

### 🔑 Examples

* **Memory Managers** → outside kernel; multiple coexisting managers possible.
* **Pagers** → implement paging policies, virtual memory, file mapping, stacked pagers, user-level paging strategies.
* **Multimedia Resource Allocation** → user-level managers can fix/lock memory for predictable performance.
* **Device Drivers** → normal user processes accessing mapped I/O + handling IPC interrupts (no need in kernel).
* **Second-Level Cache/TLB Policies** → special pagers can optimize cache/TLB hit rates.
* **Remote Communication** → IPC-based comm servers translate local → network protocols.
* **Unix Server** → runs as a server; system calls implemented via IPC.

### 📌 Takeaway

* With efficiency, µ-kernels are **highly flexible**.
* Only non-replicable parts: processor architecture itself (regs, L1 cache, L1 TLB).

---

## 4️⃣ Performance, Facts & Rumors

### 4.1 Switching Overhead

#### 4.1.1 ⚡ Kernel–User Switches

* Folklore: mode switches = expensive.
* Ousterhout measured **20–63 µs** for trivial syscall (`getpid`).
* Mach: ~18 µs per null syscall (~900 cycles at 486/50).
* Breakdown:

  * HW instructions = **107 cycles** (enter+exit).
  * Remaining **~800 cycles = pure kernel overhead** (cache/TLB misses, bad design).
* **L3 microkernel**: achieved **123–180 cycles** (~3 µs).
* Conclusion: Mode switches are not conceptually expensive → problem lies in implementation.

#### 4.1.2 📂 Address Space Switches

* HW perspective: depends on TLB design.
* **Tagged TLBs (MIPS R4000)** → free context switch (no flush).
* **Untagged TLBs (x86, PowerPC, Alpha)** → require TLB flush.
* Worst case: Pentium reload = ~864 cycles.
* Optimizations:

  * PowerPC segment registers → cheap switch (12–29 cycles).
  * x86 tricks: multiplexing address spaces into linear space (15–39 cycles).
* Conclusion: Proper techniques keep cost < 50 cycles → negligible at 100 MHz.
* Again: inefficiency in practice = due to bad design, not inherent to µ-kernel concept.

---

## 🎯 Exam-Oriented Takeaways

* µ-kernel ≠ slow by nature → performance depends on **efficient IPC & switch design**.
* Minimal primitives inside µ-kernel:

  * **Address spaces (grant, map, flush)**
  * **Threads + IPC**
  * **Unique IDs**
* Flexibility: paging, FS, device drivers, even UNIX → implemented at user level.
* Main conceptual barrier = none → only implementation pitfalls.

## ⚙️ 4.1.3 Thread Switches & IPC

### 💡 What’s being measured?

* **Ping–pong RPC** of **1 byte** between two user processes (cross address space).
* Captures: **syscall entry/exit**, **arg copy**, **thread switch**, **addr-space switch**, **stack switch**.

### 📊 Key datapoints (round-trip RPC → 2× IPC ops)

* **L3 (486/50 MHz)**: ~**10 µs** round-trip ⇒ ~**250 cycles per one-way IPC**.
* Other systems (QNX, Mach on various CPUs, Amoeba, Spin, SRC RPC) range **~76–800 µs** round-trip → **orders slower** than L3.
* **Takeaway**: It is **proven by construction** that ~**10 µs** RT (i.e., **fast IPC**) is achievable on commodity HW of that era—**40–80× faster** than classic Unix pipe echo tests.

### 🧩 Architecture matters

* **Trap cost** differences: 486 traps are ~**100 cycles** more expensive than SPARC traps → impacts absolute IPC times.
* **Register windows (SPARC)** and **segment tricks (x86/Pentium)** change the calculus.

### 🧪 Pentium experiment: segment-based address-space switch vs page-table switch

* Scenario: App with stable WS (**2–64** data pages) does a short RPC to a tiny server (WS≈**2** pages), then **re-touches its WS**.
* Measured: **RT RPC time + time to re-establish the app’s working set**, repeated 100k×.
* **Result**: **Segment switching** dramatically outperforms **page-table switching** across WS sizes (by avoiding TLB flush and reducing misses).
* **Interpretation**: With the right mechanism (segmented remap on x86, segment regs on PowerPC), **addr-space switching overhead is kept tiny**, and the **post-RPC WS rebuild** cost stays low.

### ✅ Section conclusion

* **Fast IPC is feasible** (low hundreds of cycles one-way) on µkernels with careful design.
* **Even hardware interrupts** can be modeled as **messages** and handled through the **same fast IPC path** without becoming a bottleneck.

## 🧮 4.2 Memory Effects

### 🎯 Question

Do µkernels inherently degrade **memory system performance** (e.g., raise **MCPI**: memory cycles per instruction)?

### 🧷 Study compared

* **Ultrix** (large monolithic Unix) vs **Mach µkernel + Unix server** (with emulation lib).
* Metric: **MCPI** (averaged over user+system execution).

### 📌 Observations from Chen & Bershad (and others)

* For several programs (e.g., **sed, egrep, yacc, gcc, compress, espresso, Andrew benchmark**), **Mach+Unix-server** shows **higher MCPI** than Ultrix (sometimes up to **+0.25 MCPI**).
* **But** the increase is **localized to system cache misses**:

  * “White bars” (user i/d-cache + system WB stalls + uncached reads) are **~equal** between Ultrix and Mach.
  * The **difference** arises from **system i/d-cache misses** in Mach case.

### 🔍 Conflict vs capacity misses

* Using simulated **2-way cache** to gauge conflicts:

  * **Mach’s ratio of conflict:capacity misses is actually *lower* than Ultrix**.
  * So, the extra misses aren’t explained by structural conflicts due to µkernel architecture.

### 🧭 Likely cause

* **Higher cache consumption of the µkernel path** (Mach kernel + trap/IPC/memmgmt), **not** the presence of a user-level Unix server:

  * Programs spent **fewer instructions** in the **Unix server** than Ultrix’s equivalent kernel routines.
  * Emulation lib accounts for **≤3%** system overhead.
* Therefore: **Mach’s kernel path** (trap handling, IPC, VM) likely has a **big cache working set** → **more system cache misses**.

### 🧱 What does NOT explain the gap

* **µkernel architecture per se** (i.e., separation into servers) doesn’t inherently cause higher MCPI.
* **Context switching itself**: Prior work (Mogul & Borg) shows cache disruption after **preemptive** switches between **large-WS apps**—that’s a **workload/timesharing effect**, not a µkernel trait.
* Liedtke (4.1.2–4.1.3) already shows **µkernel context switches** can be made **cheap**; the **cost gap** isn’t from “many spaces = slow”.

### 🧠 Design implication

* To avoid memory degradation: **drastically reduce the µkernel’s cache working set** (hot path footprint).
* Example: **L3** needs **< 1 KB** of kernel footprint for **short IPC**; large messages can be done via **mapping** to avoid flooding caches with copies.

### ✅ Section conclusion

* The hypothesis that **µkernels inherently** degrade memory systems is **not supported**.
* The evidence suggests **implementation-specific cache bloat** in Mach’s kernel path is the culprit.
* **A lean µkernel** (small hot path, mapping for bulk transfer) **avoids** the observed MCPI penalties.

---

## 🧪 Exam Triggers & One-liners

* **Q:** Why do some studies observe worse MCPI under µkernels?
  **A:** Not due to µkernel architecture; due to **large cache working set** in specific µkernel implementations (e.g., Mach’s trap/IPC/VM path).

* **Q:** Can IPC be fast enough for interrupt handling?
  **A:** **Yes**—L3 demonstrates **~250 cycles** per one-way IPC; interrupts modeled as messages are practical.

* **Q:** What mechanisms keep addr-space switch cheap?
  **A:** **Tagged TLBs** (MIPS) or **segment remapping** (PowerPC/x86 tricks) → avoid full TLB flush; keep **<50 cycles** overhead.

* **Q:** Why segment-based switch beats page-table switch on Pentium?
  **A:** It avoids **TLB shootdown/reload**, preserving WS and cutting **post-RPC re-touch** costs.

* **Q:** How to prevent cache thrash in IPC?
  **A:** Keep kernel **hot path tiny**; use **map/grant/flush** instead of copying **long** payloads.

Here are **shorter, exam-ready Obsidian notes** for **§5 Non-Portability**:

# 📝 µKernel Notes – Section 5 Non-Portability

---

## 🚫 Non-Portability of µ-kernels

* Early µ-kernels built over a **machine-independent abstraction layer** → easy to port, but **too slow**.
* Problems of abstract HW layer:

  * Can’t exploit **HW-specific features**.
  * Can’t avoid **HW-specific bottlenecks**.
  * Extra abstraction layer itself adds overhead.
* Lesson: µ-kernels are as **processor-dependent** as compiler code generators → algorithms & design must adapt to hardware.

---

## 🔄 5.1 Compatible Processors (486 → Pentium)

* Even “compatible” CPUs differ in ways that **force µ-kernel redesign**.
* Example differences: cache size/associativity, trap cost, segment register cost.
* **Address space switching**:

  * 486 → conventional page table switch better.
  * Pentium → **segment register method wins** (fewer TLB flushes, cheaper traps).
* **IPC optimization**: Pentium’s weaker associativity causes more cache conflicts → solved by **realigning thread control blocks**.
* Implication: Small HW changes require **major µ-kernel rewrites** (affects address spaces, IPC, TCBs, even UID structure).

---

## ⚔️ 5.2 Incompatible Processors

* CPUs differ **radically**: page tables, protection models, page sizes, TLBs, caches (tagged/untagged, virtual/physical).
* Example: **L3 (486)** vs **Exokernel (R2000)**

  * L3 IPC ≈ **250 cycles**.
  * Exo PCT ≈ **35 cycles**; equivalent Exo-IPC ≈ **~100 cycles (486-equivalent)**.
  * Difference not due to architecture type, but **processor features**:

    * 486 = expensive traps + mandatory TLB flush.
    * R2000 = cheap traps + tagged TLB.
* Lesson: **Processor memory model & TLB design dominate µ-kernel cost structure.**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

* µ-kernels = the **processor-dependent foundation** of OSes.
* They are **not portable** across CPUs; must be tuned like microcode.
* But they **enable portability at higher levels** (servers, APIs) once tuned for the hardware.
