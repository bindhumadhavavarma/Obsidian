### **1. What are the two main functions of an operating system?**

The two primary functions of an operating system are:

1. **Abstracting hardware** – The OS provides application programs with a **clean and consistent interface** to interact with hardware resources like memory, CPU, and I/O devices, instead of dealing with low-level hardware details.
2. **Managing resources** – The OS efficiently **allocates and manages system resources** (CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals) among multiple users and processes while ensuring security, efficiency, and fairness.

---

### **2. What is multiprogramming?**

**Multiprogramming** is a technique where **multiple programs are loaded into memory simultaneously**, and the CPU switches between them to maximize utilization. When one program **waits for I/O operations to complete**, the CPU executes another program instead of remaining idle. This increases **CPU efficiency** and improves **system throughput**.

---

### **3. In Sec. 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of possible applications for each of these system types (at least one for each).**

1. **Mainframe OS** – Used in **banking systems** for handling millions of transactions.
2. **Server OS** – Runs on **web servers**, **cloud computing platforms**, and enterprise applications.
3. **Multiprocessor OS** – Used in **high-performance computing (HPC)**, **supercomputers**, and scientific simulations.
4. **Personal Computer (PC) OS** – Used in **laptops, desktops, and gaming PCs** (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
5. **Real-Time OS (RTOS)** – Used in **aircraft control systems, medical devices, and industrial automation** where response time is critical.
6. **Embedded OS** – Runs on **IoT devices, smart appliances, automotive control systems**.
7. **Smart Card OS** – Used in **credit cards, SIM cards, and digital ID cards**.
8. **Mobile OS** – Powers **smartphones and tablets** (e.g., Android, iOS).
9. **Distributed OS** – Manages **distributed computing clusters**, such as those in **Google's cloud infrastructure**.

---

### **4. To use cache memory, main memory is divided into cache lines, typically 32 or 64 bytes long. An entire cache line is cached at once. What is the advantage of caching an entire line instead of a single byte or word at a time?**

Fetching an **entire cache line** instead of a single byte/word improves **performance** because:

- **Spatial locality** – Programs **often access nearby memory locations**, so caching a full line reduces future memory accesses.
- **Reduced memory latency** – Since accessing memory is **slow**, fetching multiple bytes at once ensures **fewer slow accesses**.
- **Better CPU efficiency** – More data is available in **faster cache memory**, minimizing **CPU stalls** due to memory access delays.

---

### **5. What is spooling? Do you think that advanced personal computers will have spooling as a standard feature in the future?**

**Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line)** is a process where **data is temporarily stored on disk** before being sent to a slower I/O device (e.g., printer queues print jobs instead of processing them immediately).

Advanced personal computers **already use spooling**, such as in print queues. However, with modern **fast storage and high-speed peripherals**, the **need for spooling is decreasing**, except in cases where I/O speeds vary significantly (e.g., cloud printing, networked file transfers).

---

### **6. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA). What implications does this have for multiprogramming?**

Without **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**, the CPU had to manually handle all **I/O transfers**, making it **unavailable for other tasks** during data movement. This severely **limited multiprogramming**, as the CPU was frequently occupied with I/O instead of executing other processes.

---

### **7. Why was timesharing not widespread on second-generation computers?**

Second-generation computers were built using **transistors** but lacked the **hardware support** for efficient **context switching**, memory protection, and fast disk storage—features necessary for **timesharing**. Additionally, the high cost and lack of efficient **interactive terminals** made timesharing impractical.

---

### **8. Instructions related to accessing I/O devices are typically privileged instructions, that is, they can be executed in kernel mode but not in user mode. Give a reason why these instructions are privileged.**

I/O instructions are privileged because **direct access to hardware** by user programs can cause:

- **Security risks** – A user could access **restricted data** or **modify system-critical settings**.
- **System instability** – Uncontrolled I/O access **could interfere** with the operations of other processes.
- **Resource conflicts** – Prevents multiple programs from issuing conflicting commands to the same hardware.

Thus, **only the OS kernel** is allowed to execute I/O instructions, ensuring **controlled and secure access** to system resources.

---

### **9. One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was the cost of the hardware needed to support them. How much video RAM is needed to support a 25-line × 80-row character monochrome text screen? How much for a 1024 × 768-pixel 24-bit color bitmap? What was the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)? How much is it now?**

#### **Monochrome Text Mode (25 × 80 characters)**

- Each character requires **1 byte**.
- **25 × 80 = 2000 bytes (~2 KB).**
- Cost in 1980: **$10 (2 KB × $5/KB).**

#### **1024 × 768 24-bit Color Display**

- **Each pixel requires 3 bytes (24 bits).**
- **Total size = 1024 × 768 × 3 ≈ 2.25 MB (~2304 KB).**
- Cost in 1980: **$11,520 (2304 KB × $5/KB).**
- Cost today: **Negligible (few cents due to cheap RAM).**

---

### **10. There are several design goals in building an operating system, for example, resource utilization, timeliness, robustness, and so on. Give an example of two design goals that may contradict one another.**

1. **Performance vs. Security** – High security (e.g., encryption, strict access controls) often **reduces performance**.
2. **Flexibility vs. Simplicity** – A highly flexible OS (customizable features) can **increase complexity**, making it harder to maintain.

---

### **11. What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain how having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system.**

- **Kernel mode** – OS has **full access** to hardware and system resources.
- **User mode** – Applications run with **restricted access**, preventing direct hardware manipulation.

Having **two modes** improves **security and stability** by ensuring **only the OS kernel can access critical resources** while user applications operate in a **safe, controlled environment**.

---

### **12. A 255-GB disk has 65,536 cylinders with 255 sectors per track and 512 bytes per sector. How many platters and heads does this disk have? Assuming an average cylinder seek time of 11 msec, average rotational delay of 7 msec, and a reading rate of 100 MB/sec, calculate the average time it will take to read 100 KB from one sector.**

#### **Number of Platters & Heads**

Each **cylinder contains 255 sectors** × **512 bytes** = **130,560 bytes per track**.  
Total disk size = **255 GB (≈ 255 × 1024³ bytes)**.  
Number of heads = **(Total bytes) ÷ (Bytes per cylinder)**.

#### **Read Time Calculation**

- **Seek time = 11 ms**
- **Rotational delay = 7 ms**
- **Transfer time = (100 KB ÷ 100 MB/s) = 1 ms**
- **Total average read time ≈ 11 + 7 + 1 = 19 ms**

---
### 14. List some differences between personal computer operating systems and mainframe operating systems.

**Answer:**

- **Personal computer OS** is designed for a single user, optimized for responsiveness and usability (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Mainframe OS** handles multiple users and high-volume transactions, prioritizing reliability, scalability, and security (e.g., z/OS, IBM i).
- **PC OS supports** a variety of applications (gaming, browsing, productivity), whereas **Mainframe OS** is optimized for batch processing, database management, and enterprise applications.
- **PC OS typically uses fewer resources**, while **Mainframe OS** is designed for massive workloads with high fault tolerance.

### 17. When a user program makes a system call to read or write a disk file, it provides an indication of which file it wants, a pointer to the data buffer, and the count. Control is then transferred to the operating system, which calls the appropriate driver. Suppose that the driver starts the disk and terminates until an interrupt occurs. In the case of reading from the disk, obviously, the caller will have to be blocked (because there are no data for it). What about the case of writing to the disk? Need the caller be blocked awaiting completion of the disk transfer?

**Answer:**  
Not necessarily. If the system supports **buffered I/O**, the write operation can be stored in a buffer, allowing the process to continue execution while the OS writes the data in the background. However, in **synchronous (blocking) writes**, the process will be blocked until the data is fully written to the disk.

---

### 18. What is the key difference between a trap and an interrupt?

**Answer:**

- A **trap** is a software-generated interrupt, usually triggered by an error (e.g., division by zero) or a system call.
- An **interrupt** is hardware-generated, signaling an external event like keyboard input or a completed I/O operation.

---

### 19. Is there any reason why you might want to mount a file system on a nonempty directory? If so, what is it?

**Answer:**  
Yes. Mounting a file system on a nonempty directory allows accessing the new file system under that directory while temporarily **hiding the existing contents**. This is useful in system upgrades, networked storage, or virtualization scenarios.

---

### 20. What is the purpose of a system call in an operating system?

**Answer:**  
A **system call** provides an interface between user programs and the OS, allowing controlled access to kernel services like file operations, process control, memory management, and hardware interaction.

---

### 21. Give one reason why mounting file systems is a better design option than prefixing path names with a drive name or number. Explain why file systems are almost always mounted on empty directories.

**Answer:**

- **Mounting is flexible**: It integrates multiple storage devices into a single hierarchy instead of separate drive letters (like in Windows).
- **Empty directories avoid confusion**: If mounted on a nonempty directory, the existing contents are hidden, which might lead to unintended data loss or inaccessibility.

---

### 22. For each of the following system calls, give a condition that causes it to fail:

**open** – The file does not exist (unless O_CREAT is used) or the user lacks permission.  
**close** – The file descriptor is invalid or already closed.  
**lseek** – The file is not seekable (e.g., a pipe or socket).

---

### 23. What type of multiplexing (time, space, or both) can be used for sharing the following resources?

**CPU** – **Time multiplexing** (processes take turns).  
**Memory** – **Space multiplexing** (divided among processes).  
**SSD/Disk** – **Both** (time-sharing for I/O requests, space-sharing for file storage).  
**Network Card** – **Both** (time for data transmission, space for buffers).  
**Printer** – **Time multiplexing** (print jobs queued).  
**Keyboard** – **Time multiplexing** (used by one process at a time).  
**Display** – **Both** (different windows for space, time-sharing when switching).

---

### 24. Can the `count = write(fd, buffer, nbytes);` call return any value in `count` other than `nbytes`? If so, why?

**Answer:**  
Yes. It may write fewer bytes than requested due to buffer limitations, disk space exhaustion, or network issues in case of sockets.

---

### 25. A file whose file descriptor is `fd` contains the following sequence of bytes: **2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 4**. The following system calls are made:

scss

CopyEdit

`lseek(fd, 3, SEEK_SET); read(fd, &buffer, 4);`

**What does `buffer` contain after the read has completed?**  
**Answer:**  
The `lseek` moves the file pointer to byte **3**, so the next **4** bytes read are **8, 2, 8, 1**.

---

### 27. What is the essential difference between a block special file and a character special file?

**Answer:**

- **Block special file**: Deals with data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., disks, SSDs).
- **Character special file**: Deals with unstructured streams of characters (e.g., keyboard, mouse).

---

### 28. In the example given in Fig. 1-17, the library procedure is called `read` and the system call itself is called `read`. Is it essential that both of these have the same name? If not, which one is more important?

**Answer:**  
No, they do not need to have the same name. The **library function** is more important for portability, as it abstracts the system call details from user programs.

---

### 29. The client-server model is popular in distributed systems. Can it also be used in a single-computer system?

**Answer:**  
Yes. Even within a single system, processes can communicate using **local IPC mechanisms** like **pipes, message queues, and shared memory**, mimicking a client-server model (e.g., X11 graphical system in Linux).

---

### 30. To a programmer, a system call looks like any other call to a library procedure. Is it important that a programmer knows which library procedures result in system calls? Under what circumstances and why?

**Answer:**  
Yes, in **performance-critical** applications, since system calls involve **context switching** and are slower than purely user-space function calls. Knowing which calls invoke the kernel can help optimize performance.

---

### 31. Figure 1-23 shows that a number of UNIX system calls have no Win32 API equivalents. For each of the calls listed as having no Win32 equivalent, what are the consequences for a programmer of converting a UNIX program to run under Windows?

**Answer:**  
Some features like **file links (`link`), mounting (`mount`)**, and **signals (`kill`)** do not exist in Windows. The programmer must rewrite code using alternative **Win32 APIs**, which may involve restructuring the program significantly.

---

### 32. A portable operating system is one that can be ported from one system architecture to another without any modification. Explain why it is infeasible to build an operating system that is completely portable. Describe two high-level layers that you will have in designing an operating system that is highly portable.

**Answer:**

- **Why complete portability is infeasible**: Hardware differences (CPU instructions, memory management) require OS customization.
- **Two high-level layers**:
    1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** – Shields OS from hardware specifics.
    2. **System API Layer** – Provides a consistent interface to user programs.

---

### 33. Explain how separation of policy and mechanism aids in building microkernel-based operating systems.

**Answer:**

- **Mechanism** defines how something is done (e.g., process scheduling).
- **Policy** determines what should be done (e.g., which process gets priority).  
    Separating them makes the **OS modular**, allowing flexible policy changes without modifying core mechanisms.

---

### 34. Virtual machines have become very popular for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, they have some downsides. Name one.

**Answer:**  
Overhead: Running a full OS inside a virtual machine requires extra resources (CPU, RAM), making it **slower than native execution**.
