### üì¶ 1. Device Independence
- Programs should work with **any I/O device** (e.g., HDD, SSD, USB) **without modification**.
- Ex: A command like `sort <input >output` should not depend on whether input/output is from disk, keyboard, or screen.
- OS handles the **device-specific translations**, not the user.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è 2. Uniform Naming
- Devices and files should be **named in a uniform way**, independent of type.
- Names are treated as **strings or integers**, e.g., `/usr/ast/backup/monday` could point to a USB stick.
- In **UNIX**, devices are **mounted** in the file system tree ‚Üí device paths and file paths are interchangeable.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Error Handling
- Goal: **Handle errors as low in the stack as possible**.
- **Controller** should attempt self-correction (e.g., retry reads).
- **Device drivers** retry or mask transient errors (e.g., dust-caused read error).
- Only **non-recoverable** issues are passed to higher software layers.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è 4. Synchronous vs Asynchronous I/O
- **Physical I/O** is usually **asynchronous** (interrupt-driven).
- **User programs prefer synchronous (blocking)** I/O for ease:
  - E.g., `read()` suspends until data is available.
- OS responsibility: **Convert async events to blocking abstractions**.
- But for high-performance needs, OS also exposes **true asynchronous I/O APIs**.

---

### üß† 5. Buffering
- Data often cannot go **directly to final destination**.
- Reasons:
  - Need to **inspect** incoming data before deciding where it belongs (e.g., networking).
  - Devices with **real-time constraints** (e.g., audio) need **pre-filled output buffers** to avoid underruns.
- Buffering introduces:
  - **Copying overhead**
  - Significant **impact on performance**

---

### üë• 6. Sharable vs Dedicated Devices
- **Sharable Devices**: Disks, SSDs ‚Üí allow concurrent access (multiple open files).
- **Dedicated Devices**: Printers, scanners ‚Üí must be assigned **to one user at a time**.
- Problems with dedicated devices:
  - Require **exclusive access** control.
  - Can cause **deadlocks** if not managed properly.
- OS must implement **access coordination**, queuing, and locking as needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5.2.2 Programmed I/O

### üõ†Ô∏è Mechanism
- CPU performs **all I/O actions** directly, **polling** the device for readiness.
- Example: A user process prints a string `"ABCDEFGH"` via serial printer.

### üì• Steps:
1. User process places string in user-space buffer.
2. System call is made ‚Üí string copied to kernel buffer.
3. OS loops:
   - Waits for printer to be ready.
   - Sends character to printer.
   - Repeats until entire string is printed.

```c
for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  while (*printer_status_reg != READY);
  *printer_data_reg = p[i];
}
```

### üîÅ Busy Waiting
- **Polling loop** wastes CPU time if I/O is slow.
- Acceptable for:
  - Very fast I/O.
  - Simple embedded systems with idle CPUs.
- ‚ùå Inefficient for multitasking systems.

---

## üîî 5.2.3 Interrupt-Driven I/O

### üì¨ Motivation
- Avoid wasting CPU time in polling.
- Instead, let the printer **interrupt** the CPU once ready.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism
1. On system call:
   - Buffer copied to kernel space.
   - First character sent to printer.
   - Process is **blocked**; scheduler runs other tasks.
2. When printer is ready:
   - **Interrupt is triggered**.
   - **Interrupt service routine (ISR)** sends next character.
   - Repeats until all characters are sent.
   - ISR unblocks the user process and returns control.

```c
// On system call
*printer_data_reg = p[0];
scheduler();

// On interrupt
if (i < count)
  *printer_data_reg = p[i++];
else
  unblock_user();
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-off
- Fewer wasted cycles.
- But one **interrupt per character** ‚Üí CPU overhead increases if character frequency is high.

---

## üöÄ 5.2.4 I/O Using DMA (Direct Memory Access)

### üß† Concept
- Offload character transfer to a **DMA controller**.
- CPU sets up the transfer, then continues its own work.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism
1. System call:
   - Buffer copied to kernel space.
   - **DMA controller is programmed** (source, count, etc.).
   - CPU yields via scheduler.
2. DMA autonomously transfers all characters to printer.
3. When transfer completes:
   - DMA triggers a **single interrupt**.
   - ISR acknowledges and unblocks the user process.

```c
// On system call
setup_dma(buffer, count);
scheduler();

// On interrupt
acknowledge();
unblock_user();
```

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- Reduces interrupts to **one per buffer**.
- Great for **large data** or frequent I/O.

### ‚ùå Limitations
- DMA may be **slower than CPU** in some cases.
- Adds **hardware complexity**.
- Not ideal if CPU has idle time or data is small.
