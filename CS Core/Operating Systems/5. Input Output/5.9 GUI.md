A **GUI** (pronounced *"gooey"*) provides a visual, interactive environment for users, involving windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices.

---

### üß™ Historical Context

- Invented by **Douglas Engelbart** at SRI; later adopted at **Xerox PARC**
- **Steve Jobs** saw Xerox's GUI ‚Üí inspired **Apple Lisa** and then **Macintosh**
- **Microsoft** licensed parts of the Mac GUI to build **Windows**
- Apple‚Äôs refusal to license the Mac GUI widely gave Microsoft the upper hand in mass adoption

### üî§ WIMP Model (Core GUI Components)

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **W**indows | Rectangular screen areas for program interaction |
| **I**cons | Clickable symbols that trigger actions |
| **M**enus | Lists of user-selectable commands or options |
| **P**ointing Device | Hardware (mouse, trackpad, etc.) to navigate and interact |

---

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI Implementation

- **UNIX**: GUI in **user space**
- **Windows**: GUI partly in **kernel space**
- **Graphics cards**:
  - Contain **video RAM** and **GPU**
  - Typical VRAM sizes: 8‚Äì16 GB
  - High refresh rates (e.g., 60 Hz) require high **memory bandwidth** (e.g., 4K @ 60 Hz ‚âà 1.5 GB/sec)

---

### ü™ü Windows and Output Model

- The **basic unit** is a **window** defined by coordinates of two corners
- May contain:
  - Title bar
  - Menu bar
  - Scrollbars
  - Toolbar
- Windows can be resized, moved, scrolled ‚Üí programs must redraw contents accordingly

---

### üßæ Windows: Event-Driven Programming

- Programs respond to **events** (mouse, keyboard, resize, etc.)
- Each program has a **message queue** for incoming events
- Main loop: fetch and dispatch messages to appropriate handlers

#### Skeleton of a Windows Main Program

```c
while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
  TranslateMessage(&msg);
  DispatchMessage(&msg);
}
```

- Events are handled in a **callback function**, e.g., `WndProc`
- Message types:
  - `WM_CREATE`, `WM_DESTROY` ‚Äì window lifecycle
  - `WM_PAINT` ‚Äì redraw when needed
  - `WM_COMMAND`, `WM_TIMER`, etc. ‚Äì other interactions

### ü™Ñ Drawing with GDI (Graphics Device Interface)

GDI is Windows‚Äô platform-independent graphics layer.

#### Basic GDI Workflow

```c
HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
TextOut(hdc, x, y, psText, iLength);
ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc);
```

- `GetDC`: acquires a **Device Context**
- `TextOut`: draws text at (x, y)
- `ReleaseDC`: releases the context

#### Example: Drawing Shapes

```c
Rectangle(hdc, 2, 1, 6, 4);  // Draws a filled rectangle
```

- Uses **clipping regions** to restrict draw area (e.g., to client area)
- Alternative: `GetWindowDC()` includes title bar and scrollbars

---

### üß™ Hungarian Notation

A naming convention invented at Microsoft:
- Prefix indicates type:
  - `iCmdShow`: integer
  - `szCmd`: zero-terminated string
  - `hWnd`: handle to a window
- Widely used in Win32 but considered redundant and outdated by many

---

### üèóÔ∏è Structure of a Win32 GUI Program

```c
WNDCLASS wndclass;         // Window class definition
RegisterClass(&wndclass);  // Register class with Windows

HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(...);  // Create window
ShowWindow(hwnd, iCmdShow);
UpdateWindow(hwnd);        // Trigger initial WM_PAINT

// Message loop
while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
  TranslateMessage(&msg);
  DispatchMessage(&msg);
}

// Event handling
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(...) {
  switch (message) {
    case WM_PAINT: // Redraw
    case WM_DESTROY: PostQuitMessage(0); break;
    default: return DefWindowProc(...);
  }
}
```

### üß∞ Drawing Categories in GDI

| Category          | Examples                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lines/Curves      | `LineTo`, `Arc`, `Polyline`        |
| Filled Areas      | `Rectangle`, `Ellipse`, `Polygon` |
| Bitmaps           | `BitBlt`, `StretchBlt`             |
| Text              | `TextOut`, `DrawText`              |

## üñºÔ∏è Bitmaps and Vector Graphics

### üìê Vector Graphics (GDI)
- Used for scalable **geometric figures** and **text**
- Device-independent; scales well to different screen sizes
- Examples: lines, rectangles, ellipses, text outlines

### üß± Bitmaps
- **Grid-based image representation**; each pixel stores RGB values
- Used for:
  - **Photographs**, **videos**
  - **Font glyphs** (in older systems)
- Windows supports **DIB** (Device-Independent Bitmap) format `.bmp` for device compatibility

---

### üõ†Ô∏è `BitBlt` ‚Äî Bitmap Block Transfer

```c
BitBlt(dsthdc, dx, dy, width, height, srchdc, sx, sy, rasterop);
```

- Copies a rectangle from **source** to **destination** window
- Can apply **Boolean raster operations**:
  - `SRCCOPY` (direct copy)
  - `SRCAND`, `SRCOR`, `SRCINVERT` (bitwise logic)
- Each window has its own coordinate system (origin at top-left)
- Limitation: Bitmaps **do not scale well** across devices (e.g., screen vs. printer)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Fonts and Text Rendering

### üñºÔ∏è Bitmap Fonts (Legacy)
- Fonts rendered as **predefined bitmaps**
- Problems:
  - Requires different bitmaps for every size and style
  - Doesn't scale well to printers (high DPI)

### üß© TrueType Fonts (Modern)
- **Outline-based** font representation
- Each glyph defined by **perimeter points**
- Easily **scalable** by multiplying all points with a scale factor
- **Rasterization**: Outline ‚Üí Bitmap at desired resolution
- Supports **hinting** for better clarity (e.g., symmetrical serifs)

### üî§ Font Scaling Example
```plaintext
20 pt:  T
53 pt:  T (bigger)
81 pt:  T (biggest)
```

## üëÜ Touch Screens

### üñ±Ô∏è Touchscreen Basics
- Allows direct interaction with screen elements via:
  - **Finger**
  - **Stylus**
- More **intuitive** than using a mouse
- Used in **phones**, **tablets**, **laptops**, **POS systems**

---

### üîç Touchscreen Types

| Type       | Surface      | How it works                                         | Multitouch |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Resistive** | Flexible plastic | Layers of conductive film; pressure closes the circuit | ‚ùå Ghosting |
| **Capacitive** | Glass         | Measures local **capacitance** changes from finger     | ‚úÖ Accurate |

- **Resistive**
  - Works with **gloved fingers**, stylus, etc.
  - Cannot easily distinguish **multi-touch** (ghosting problem)

- **Capacitive**
  - Requires **skin contact** or conductive gloves
  - Used in modern smartphones, tablets
  - Supports **multitouch gestures** (pinch, swipe, etc.)

---

### ‚úã Multitouch & Window Management
- Touching with multiple fingers = multiple mouse pointers
- Multitouch impacts:
  - Window interaction logic
  - Gesture recognition (pinch-to-zoom, swipe-to-scroll)
- OS interprets touch as a **stream of (x, y) pairs**

## üßæ 5.7 Thin Clients

### üß≠ Evolution of Computing Paradigms
- **ENIAC Era**: Personal-use only (single-user machines)
- **Timesharing Era**: Many users with **dumb terminals** connected to a central mainframe
- **PC Era**: Decentralized, user-owned personal computers
- **Modern Shift**: Returning to **centralized/cloud-based models** via thin clients and Web computing

---

### üíª PC-Centric Model ‚Äî Disadvantages
1. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - Each PC has its own **OS**, **disk**, and **software stack**
   - Software updates and OS upgrades must be done individually
   - Labor cost of maintenance often > hardware/software cost

2. **Backup Complexity**
   - Most users do not back up local storage
   - Data loss ‚Üí High risk without centralized backup

3. **Poor Resource Sharing**
   - Example: 256 PCs with 16 GB RAM each = 4 TB total RAM
     - Most of that RAM stays idle
   - Centralized 1 TB RAM pool offers **better utilization**

---

### üåê Web-Centric Computing
- Growing shift towards **cloud-hosted applications**:
  - Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo
  - Google Docs (Word processor), Sheets (Spreadsheets)
- Many users now **only use a browser** for all tasks
- Future possibility: PC acts as **just a web browser host**

---

### üí° Thin Client Philosophy
- **High performance + zero admin** is ideal for most users
- **Text terminals** (rebranded as *thin clients*) reemerge as viable options
- Goal: **Zero local software** on user machines

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Real-World Thin Clients: The Chromebook
- Developed and supported by **Google**
- Runs **ChromeOS** (based on Linux)
- Originally designed to:
  - **Run Web Apps**
  - **Stay always-online**
- Evolved to **support native Android apps**
- Still lighter than traditional OSes, but **not purely thin anymore**

---

### üîÅ Summary: Centralization Revisited
| Model         | Pros                                | Cons                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **PC Model**  | High performance, flexibility        | High maintenance, poor backup       |
| **Thin Client** | Low maintenance, centralized control | Limited offline capability, early models underpowered |
| **Hybrid (Chromebook)** | Web + local apps, better performance | Thicker stack, diverges from ideal thin client |
