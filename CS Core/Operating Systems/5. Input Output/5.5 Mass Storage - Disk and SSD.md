### 🧲 5.4.1 Magnetic Disks

#### ✅ Characteristics
- Equal speed for **reads and writes** → ideal for paging, file systems
- Used in **RAID arrays** for reliability
- Structured as:
  - **Cylinders** (group of vertically aligned tracks)
  - **Tracks** (circular data paths)
  - **Sectors** (data chunks within a track)

#### 📊 Controller Types
- **Old disks**: Controller did most work (raw bit stream from disk)
- **Modern disks (e.g. SATA)**: Microcontroller inside disk
  - Manages track caching, bad block remapping
  - Supports **overlapped seeks** and concurrent operations

#### 💡 Overlapped Seek
- Seeks initiated in parallel on multiple drives
- Reduces access time significantly
- Only **one transfer to main memory at a time**

### 🔍 Example: From Floppy to Modern Disk

| Metric               | Floppy Disk     | Seagate IronWolf Pro |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Capacity             | 360 KB           | 18 TB                |
| Transfer Rate        | 23 KB/sec        | 250 MB/sec           |
| Latency              | ~100 ms          | ~4 ms                |

---

### 🧠 Disk Geometry: Physical vs Virtual

- **Modern disks use zone recording**: more sectors on outer tracks
  - Example: Outer zone = 32 sectors/track, Inner zone = 16 sectors/track
- **Virtual Geometry**: OS sees fake fixed geometry
- **Logical Block Addressing (LBA)**: OS uses linear sector numbers

---

### 🛠️ Disk Formatting

#### ➤ Low-Level Formatting

- Sector structure:
  - `Preamble | Data | ECC`
- Preamble: ID, sync info
- ECC: Error Correction Code (~16 bytes common)
- Includes **cylinder skew** and **head skew** to avoid rotational delays

> **Cylinder Skew**: Offsetting sector 0 on adjacent tracks so that multi-track reads don’t miss the next sector due to seek delay  
> **Example**: 10,000 RPM disk, 800 µs seek time → skew ≈ 40 sectors

---

### 🔁 Interleaving for Slow Controllers

| Type               | Description                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No Interleaving     | Sectors numbered sequentially          |
| Single Interleaving | Leave 1 sector gap between consecutive |
| Double Interleaving | Leave 2 sector gaps                    |

> Prevents missing the next sector while transferring data to memory

### 📦 Partitioning and MBR/GPT

#### Partitioning Steps:
1. **Low-Level Format**
2. **Partition Table** (MBR/GPT)
3. **High-Level Format** (per partition)

#### 🧭 Partition Table (MBR)
- Sector 0 contains MBR
- MBR includes:
  - Bootloader
  - 4 partition entries
- **MBR Limit**: 2 TB due to 32-bit sector addresses

#### 🛰️ GUID Partition Table (GPT)
- Supports disks up to **9.4 ZB**
- Replaces MBR in modern systems
- Used in UEFI booting (see Sec. 4.3)

---

### 🔠 File System Booting & High-Level Format

High-level formatting involves:
- Boot block
- Free space data (bitmap or list)
- Root directory
- Empty file system metadata
- FS type code for OS recognition

> BIOS → GPT → Bootloader → OS

## 🧠 Disk Arm Scheduling Algorithms

---

### ⏱️ Components of Disk Access Time
1. **Seek time**: Move arm to correct cylinder *(dominates total time)*
2. **Rotational delay**: Wait for sector to come under head
3. **Transfer time**: Actual data movement

> ⏳ **Optimizing seek time** improves performance the most.

---

### 🧮 Scheduling Strategies

#### 📌 First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
- Process disk requests in order received.
- Simple, fair, but **inefficient**—no optimization for arm movement.

---

#### 🔁 Shortest Seek First (SSF)
- Always service the **nearest request** first.
- Significantly reduces total seek time compared to FCFS.

> Example: 7 requests, total arm motion  
> - FCFS: **111 cylinders**  
> - SSF: **61 cylinders**

##### 🚨 Problem:
- **Starvation**: Requests far from the middle (e.g., outermost cylinders) may be indefinitely delayed.

---

#### 🛗 Elevator Algorithm (SCAN)
- Arm moves in **one direction** (UP/DOWN), servicing requests on the way.
- Once no more requests in that direction, **reverses direction**.
- Keeps a **direction bit**.

> Using the same 7 requests:  
> - Elevator: **60 cylinders** total motion  
> - SSF: 61 cylinders

##### ✅ Pros:
- Bounded total arm motion: ≤ 2 × number of cylinders
- Balances **efficiency** and **fairness**

---

#### 🔁 Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
- Always **scans in one direction** (e.g., UP)
- After reaching the highest cylinder, jumps to lowest and continues
- Reduces **variance in response times**

---

### 🧭 Sector Scheduling (Fine-Grained Optimization)

- Some disk controllers expose **current sector** info under the head
- If **multiple requests on same cylinder**, choose the **next sequential sector**
- Head switching (between tracks on a cylinder) is **fast**, so it’s negligible
- For **fast seek, slow rotation**: optimize based on **sector**, not cylinder

---

### 📦 Read-Ahead & Caching

- **Modern disks read full tracks**, not just requested sector
- Prefetched data stored in **controller cache**
  - Example: Seagate IronWolf → 256 MB cache
- OS and controller have **independent caches**:
  - Controller → opportunistic prefetch
  - OS → requested blocks with future reuse probability

---

### 🧰 Multi-Drive Optimization

- Maintain **separate pending queues** for each drive
- Issue **overlapped seeks** to idle drives (if supported)
- If any drive is already on target cylinder → serve immediately
- Else, issue new seek and wait

---

### ⚠️ Virtual vs Physical Geometry

> ⚠ Disk scheduling assumes that **logical (virtual)** cylinder numbers reflect actual disk layout.

- With **logical block addressing** and **virtual geometry**, OS doesn't know actual distances.
- In such cases, **controller-level scheduling** (inside firmware) applies these optimizations.

---
## ❌ Error Handling in Disk Storage

---

### ⚙️ Background: Increasing Bit Densities
- Modern disks like **Seagate IronWolf** reach up to **2470 Kbits/inch**.
- High bit densities → high risk of **manufacturing defects**.
- As densities increase, **bad sectors** are inevitable.

---

### 🧩 Types of Errors

#### 1. **Bad Sectors**
- Small errors: ECC (Error Correcting Code) can correct.
- Large errors: require **sector remapping** (either hardware or software level).

---

### 🔄 Handling Bad Sectors

#### 🧠 Option 1: **Handled by Controller**
- **Factory testing** marks bad sectors.
- Uses **spare sectors** for substitution.

##### Two remapping approaches:
- **(b) Substitution**: Replace only the bad sector.
- **(c) Shifting**: Shift all subsequent sectors one forward.

> Method (c) is more performant but harder to apply post-deployment.

---

#### 💻 Option 2: **Handled by Operating System**
- Builds remap table using disk test or factory list.
- Must avoid allocating bad sectors to files or free lists.
- Creates a **hidden ‘bad sector file’** (invisible even to backup utilities).

---

### 🔄 Dealing with Runtime Errors

#### 🔁 Transient Read Errors
- Retry read—often caused by dust, can succeed on retry.

#### 🧠 Predictive Remapping
- If error pattern is detected, controller proactively remaps to spare sector.
- Typically uses method (b) due to live data in sectors.

---

### 🧪 Additional Error Sources

#### 🧭 Seek Errors
- Caused by **mechanical arm issues**.
- Controller recalibrates by moving head to cylinder 0.

#### 🖥️ Controller Failures
- Controllers are embedded **mini-computers**.
- Bugs or race conditions (e.g., interrupt during recalibration) may cause hangs.
- Fallback:
  - **Reset pin** on chip
  - Driver may issue **reset command**
  - If that fails: **print error and abort**

---

### ⏱️ Real-Time Constraints

- **Recalibrations disrupt real-time data flow**
  - e.g., playing videos, burning Blu-rays
- Solution: **AV Disks (Audio-Visual Disks)**
  - Designed to avoid recalibrations
  - Ensures uninterrupted data streaming

---

### 💀 Disk Firmware Exploits

- **Disk controllers** can run full **ARM multicore processors**
- Hackers can load **custom firmware** onto disks
- Danger:
  - Acts as a **stealth backdoor**
  - Persists even after OS reinstall
- Can also be repurposed to **build a cluster** from e-waste disks
