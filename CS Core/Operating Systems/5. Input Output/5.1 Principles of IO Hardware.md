The OS is responsible for managing all I/O devices:
- Issues commands, handles interrupts, manages errors.
- Offers a clean, uniform interface to diverse hardware (device independence).
- I/O code makes up a large part of the OS.

## 🔌 5.1 Principles of I/O Hardware

### 🔁 5.1.1 I/O Devices

Devices are **classified into two broad types**:

#### 📦 Block Devices:
- Store data in **addressable, fixed-size blocks** (512 B to 64 KB).
- Supports **random access** to blocks.
- Ex: Hard disks, SSDs, magnetic tape drives (still used in data centers; e.g., LTO-8: 12 TB, 750 MB/s, 30 years, <$100).

#### 🔤 Character Devices:
- Handle **sequential streams of data**, **no addressing or seek**.
- Ex: Keyboards, mice, network interfaces, printers.
- Some devices (clocks, memory-mapped screens) don’t neatly fit this classification.

#### 📊 I/O Speed Variability:
Device speeds vary **drastically**:
| Device | Data Rate |
|--------|-----------|
| Keyboard | 10 B/s |
| USB 2.0 | 60 MB/s |
| USB 3.0 | 625 MB/s |
| PCIe Gen 3 SSD | 3.5 GB/s |
| PCIe Gen 6 | 126 GB/s |

### 🧠 5.1.2 Device Controllers

Most I/O systems have:
- A **mechanical component** (e.g., disk, printer)
- An **electronic component** (controller/adapter)

#### 🧩 Role of Controller:
- Modularizes the system (often a chip/card on the motherboard).
- Interfaces with mechanical device (e.g., over USB, SATA).
- Translates low-level hardware signals into **byte blocks**.
- Performs **error correction** (e.g., ECC) before passing data to memory.

#### 🖥️ Display Controllers:
- Drive **LCD screens** by controlling electric fields.
- OS sets display parameters; controller manages pixel updates.
- Modern LCDs replaced CRTs, which used magnetic beam control over a fluorescent screen.

---
## 🧠 5.1.3 Memory-Mapped I/O

### 📦 Communication with Devices
- Devices have **control registers** and **data buffers**.
- OS uses control registers to:
  - Command devices (start/stop, send/receive)
  - Query device status
- Data buffers (e.g., video RAM) hold I/O data like display pixels.

---

### 🔧 Two Approaches to Access Devices

#### 1. **I/O Port Space (Separate Address Space)**
- Each device register is assigned a port number.
- Access via special instructions:
  - `IN REG, PORT` (read from port)
  - `OUT PORT, REG` (write to port)
- Memory and I/O are **separate address spaces**.
- Example: IBM 360, mainframes.

#### 2. **Memory-Mapped I/O**
- Device registers are mapped into the **memory address space**.
- No separate I/O instructions—regular memory instructions suffice.
- Common in modern systems like the PDP-11.

#### 3. **Hybrid Scheme**
- Control registers use I/O ports; data buffers are memory-mapped.
- Used in x86 (640K–1M for device buffers, ports 0–64K).

---

### ✅ Advantages of Memory-Mapped I/O

- 🧑‍💻 **Easier programming**: Devices accessed like variables in C.
- 🔒 **Simple protection**: OS can control access via virtual memory mapping.
- 🧩 **Modularity**: Allows running device drivers in **user mode**, reduces kernel crashes.
- 🔄 **Instruction reuse**: Normal memory instructions can be used for device operations (e.g., TEST).

#### Example Assembly Loop:
```asm
LOOP: TEST PORT 4   // check if port 4 = 0
      BEQ READY     // jump if ready
      BRANCH LOOP   // continue testing
READY:
```
Without memory-mapped I/O → requires more instructions.

---

### ⚠️ Disadvantages of Memory-Mapped I/O

#### 🧠 Caching Conflicts
- **Device registers must not be cached**.
- Risk: value may be cached, not updated, leading to infinite polling.
- Solution: **selective caching per page** — adds hardware + OS complexity.

#### 🛣️ Memory Bus Complexity
- With a dedicated **memory bus** (Fig. 5-3b), I/O devices can't "see" memory addresses.
- Must use additional techniques:
  - Send all addresses to memory first, then fallback to I/O
  - Snooping devices to tap memory bus
  - **Filter addresses** via memory controller range registers

---

### 🏗️ Architectural Trade-Offs

| Aspect | Port-Mapped I/O | Memory-Mapped I/O |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Assembly required | Yes | No |
| Instruction reuse | No | Yes |
| Caching conflict | No | Yes (unless disabled) |
| OS control | Port protection | Virtual memory mapping |
| Performance | May require more instructions | Efficient access, but hardware needs careful design |

## ⚡ 5.1.4 Direct Memory Access (DMA)

### 🎯 Purpose
- Avoids CPU involvement in **data transfer**, improving performance.
- CPU configures a **DMA controller** to handle block transfers directly between **I/O devices and memory**.

---

### 🧩 How DMA Works

![[{936C5003-E39C-4081-8650-356401231D8D}.png]]
1. **CPU programs DMA controller**:
   - Sets memory address, byte count, direction, device info.
2. **I/O device reads into its internal buffer**.
3. **DMA controller takes control of the bus**.
4. **Transfers data from device to memory** (or vice versa).
5. **DMA controller interrupts CPU when done**.

> ✅ Unlike CPU-based transfer, **CPU does not read/write each byte** manually.

---

### 📌 DMA Controller Components
- **Memory Address Register** – where to read/write in memory.
- **Byte Count Register** – how much to transfer.
- **Control Register** – direction, transfer mode, device, etc.

---

### 💡 DMA Transfer Steps (Disk Read Example)
```text
1. CPU configures DMA controller.
2. Disk controller reads block into internal buffer, verifies checksum.
3. DMA controller requests word from disk controller.
4. Word is placed on system bus, written to memory.
5. DMA updates address/count, repeats steps 3–4.
6. When done, it interrupts CPU.
```

---

### 🔁 Transfer Modes

| Mode           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Cycle Stealing** | DMA "steals" bus access for one word at a time. Slows CPU slightly. |
| **Burst Mode**     | DMA locks the bus for a block transfer. Efficient but **can block CPU**. |
| **Fly-by Mode**    | Data goes **directly from I/O to memory** without CPU intervention. |

---

### 🧠 Buffering Inside Controller
- **Reason 1**: To verify **checksum** before sending to memory.
- **Reason 2**: Handle **bus unavailability** during burst — avoids overrun.
- **Without buffer**: risk of **transfer errors** or **overruns**.

---

### 🧠 Advanced DMA Features

- Support for **multiple channels** (via multiple register sets).
- Can **schedule transfers** using priority or round-robin.
- Some support **device-to-device** or **memory-to-memory** copies.

---

### 📍 Physical vs Virtual Addresses

| Type                | Notes |
|---------------------|-------|
| **Physical Address** | Most common; OS translates virtual address before configuring DMA. |
| **Virtual Address**  | Rare; DMA must go through MMU or **IOMMU** (used in some modern systems). |

> 🧠 With IOMMU, devices can use their **own virtual address space** for safe, remapped memory access.

---

### 🚫 Why Some Systems Skip DMA
- On **low-end/embedded systems**, CPU is faster than DMA controller.
- **Cost-saving**: removing DMA controller saves silicon and simplifies design.
- If CPU is idle and I/O speed is the bottleneck, **DMA offers no advantage**.
