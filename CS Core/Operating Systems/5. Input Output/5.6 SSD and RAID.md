## ⚡ 5.4.2 Solid State Drives (SSDs)

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics
- **No moving parts** → faster and more durable than magnetic disks.
- **Asymmetric performance**: Reads are typically faster than writes.
- Used widely in modern systems as primary storage devices.

---

### 📦 SSD Interfaces

#### 1. **SATA SSDs**
- Legacy interface, originally designed for **mechanical disks**.
- Limits SSD performance due to narrow command queues and slower interface.

#### 2. **NVMe SSDs** (Non-Volatile Memory Express)
- Designed to fully exploit **PCIe** interface.
- Supports **high-speed parallel access** and **lower latency**.
- NVMe architecture is optimized for:
  - **Multi-core processors**
  - **Parallel flash chip access**

---

### 🧵 NVMe Queues: Structure & Benefits

- **Multiple Queues per Core**
  - Each CPU core can have:
    - A **Submission Queue** (to send commands)
    - A **Completion Queue** (to receive results)

- **Doorbell Mechanism**
  - After filling the submission queue, the CPU core writes to a *doorbell register*.
  - This alerts the SSD controller to process pending commands.

- **Parallel Processing**
  - NVMe supports:
    - Up to **64K queues**, each with up to **64K commands**.
  - Enables SSD to handle high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).

### ✅ Advantages of NVMe over SATA

| Feature                     | SATA               | NVMe                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Queue depth                | 1 queue, ~32 cmds   | 64K queues × 64K cmds each |
| Parallelism                | Limited             | Per-core queues             |
| Latency                    | Higher              | Lower                       |
| Power efficiency           | Moderate            | Better (fewer drives needed)|
| Software layers            | More overhead       | Fewer layers (more direct access) |

- **System efficiency improves**: fewer devices needed for same throughput.
- **Reduced power & cooling needs** due to better performance per watt.
- **File systems benefit** from more direct access to storage.

### 🧰 NVMe Drivers in Operating Systems
- Most OSes (Linux, Windows, macOS) now **natively support NVMe**.
- NVMe driver stack often includes:
  - **Hardware-independent logic**
  - **PCIe communication module**
  - Optional: **NVMe over TCP or RDMA modules**

> Thanks to NVMe standardization, **a single OS driver can handle all NVMe-compliant SSDs**.

## 🛡️ 5.4.3 Stable Storage

### 💡 Motivation
- Disk and CPU failures can cause:
  - **Incorrect writes** (corrupted sectors)
  - **Data loss**
- For critical applications, **data must either be written correctly or not at all**.
- Goal: A disk system where **writes are either successful or leave the old value intact**.

---

### ✅ Assumptions
1. **ECC detects most write errors** — probability of undetected errors is extremely low (≈ 2⁻¹⁴⁴).
2. **Spontaneous block decay is rare**, and *simultaneous decay on both drives* is negligible.
3. **CPU failures halt all in-progress disk writes**.
4. The system uses **two identical disks**, where each logical block is stored on both.

---

### 🔁 Stable Storage Operations

#### 1. 📝 Stable Write
- Write block to **Disk 1** → verify → retry if needed (up to *n* times).
- If it fails after *n* attempts → remap to spare sector.
- Once Disk 1 is successful → do the same on **Disk 2**.
- Ensures **both disks contain correct block** before write is considered successful.

#### 2. 📖 Stable Read
- Try reading from **Disk 1**.
  - If ECC fails → retry up to *n* times.
  - If still fails → read from **Disk 2**.
- Based on assumption: *at least one copy is correct*.

#### 3. 🔄 Crash Recovery
- After crash: scan both disks block-by-block.
  - If both are valid and equal → OK.
  - If one is bad → copy from the good one.
  - If both valid but unequal → copy from **Disk 1 to Disk 2**.

---

### 💥 Crash Scenarios

| Crash Point      | Result | Recovery Action |
|------------------|--------|------------------|
| (a) Before any write | Both old values remain | No action needed |
| (b) During Disk 1 write | Disk 1 corrupted, Disk 2 intact | Copy from Disk 2 to Disk 1 |
| (c) Between Disk 1 and 2 write | Disk 1 has new data | Copy from Disk 1 to Disk 2 |
| (d) During Disk 2 write | Disk 2 corrupted | Copy from Disk 1 to Disk 2 |
| (e) After both writes | Both blocks are new | No action needed |

---

### 🧠 Optimization Using Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM)
- Store the **block number being written** in NVRAM before write begins.
- After successful stable write, **clear the block number** (e.g., write invalid marker like `<1`).
- During recovery:
  - Check NVRAM → if valid block number exists, verify and fix both disks.

---

### 🛠️ If NVRAM Is Not Available
- Simulate using **special fixed block** on both disks:
  - Write block number to special block on Disk 1 → verify
  - Do the same on Disk 2
  - After write is complete → overwrite both with an invalid number
- Downside: **Adds 8 disk I/Os** per stable write → use sparingly

---

### 📅 Periodic Maintenance
- Even if errors are rare:
  - Over time, both blocks could go bad.
- **Run full scan daily**:
  - Repair any inconsistencies.
  - Ensure both disks remain **identical and correct**.

## 🧱 5.4.3 RAID – Redundant Array of Independent Disks

---

### 🎯 Motivation
- Disk I/O performance lagged far behind CPU performance.
- Parallelism in disk access was introduced to **improve performance and reliability**.
- RAID = Redundant Array of Inexpensive (later "Independent") Disks.
- Replacement for SLED (Single Large Expensive Disk).

---

### ⚙️ Basic RAID Architecture
- A RAID system contains **multiple disks**, a **RAID controller**, and appears as a **single logical disk** to the OS.
- **Data striping** is used to distribute data across disks.
- Key RAID benefits:
  - **Parallel I/O** → higher throughput
  - **Redundancy** → better reliability

---

### 🧩 RAID Levels Overview

![[Pasted image 20250414193256.png]]

#### **RAID 0 – Striping (No Redundancy)**
- Data is striped across *k* disks in a round-robin pattern.
- Great for **large, sequential reads/writes**.
- No fault tolerance: **any disk failure = complete data loss**.
- ⚠️ Not a "true" RAID (no redundancy).

#### **RAID 1 – Mirroring**
- All data is **duplicated** across mirrored disks.
- Write performance = single drive.
- Read performance: **up to 2× better** due to load distribution.
- **Excellent fault tolerance**; easy recovery by copying from backup.

#### **RAID 2 – Bit-Level Striping with Hamming Code**
- Each bit of data + parity bits (e.g., Hamming) are spread over separate disks.
- Disks must be **synchronized**.
- Used in special systems (e.g., Thinking Machines CM-2).
- High throughput but **high controller complexity** and overhead.

#### **RAID 3 – Byte/Word Striping with Single Parity Disk**
- Data striped at byte/word level; single dedicated **parity disk**.
- Can **recover from single disk failure** by XORing parity with others.
- Requires disk synchronization.
- High bandwidth, but **poor IOPS** (I/O operations per second).

#### **RAID 4 – Block-Level Striping with Dedicated Parity**
- Like RAID 0, but with an **extra parity disk**.
- On write:
  - Read old data & parity
  - Update parity
  - Write data + parity
- **Parity disk is a bottleneck** for small writes.

#### **RAID 5 – Block-Level Striping with Distributed Parity**
- Distributes both **data and parity** across all disks.
- Avoids parity bottleneck of RAID 4.
- More complex rebuilds on failure.

#### **RAID 6 – Dual Parity**
- Like RAID 5 but with **two parity blocks** per stripe.
- Can tolerate **2 simultaneous disk failures**.
- Read performance = RAID 5
- Write performance = slightly worse (more parity calculations).
- Suitable for higher-reliability use cases.

---

### ⚡ RAID + SSDs

- SSDs are fast and reliable, but **RAID still useful**:
  - **RAID 0** over SSDs: excellent sequential throughput.
  - **RAID 1**: improves read reliability (and sometimes speed).
  - **RAID 5/6**:
    - More resilient, **but write-heavy**.
    - SSDs suffer more from frequent writes (wear-leveling, endurance).
