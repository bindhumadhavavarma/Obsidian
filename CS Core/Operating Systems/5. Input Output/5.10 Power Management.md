### 🧠 Why Power Management Matters
- **Past**: ENIAC consumed 140,000W; power was a key constraint.
- **Post-transistor era**: Efficiency improved; power concerns faded.
- **Present**: Power is again a **central concern** due to:
  - Environmental impact (e.g., 100M PCs = 20 nuclear plants)
  - Limited battery life in **portable devices**
  - Increasing demand for performance with constrained energy budgets

### ⚙️ 5.8.1 Hardware Issues

#### 🔌 Battery Technology
- **Types**: 
  - Disposable: AAA, AA, D cells (low capacity)
  - Rechargeable: NiCd → NiMH → **Li-ion** (modern standard)
- **Challenge**: Minimal innovation in capacity over time

#### 🔄 Device Power States
- Devices have multiple states: **On**, **Sleep**, **Hibernate**, **Off**
- OS manages transitions to balance **power saving vs. wake latency**
- Devices vary in:
  - # of power states
  - Resume time
  - Energy to restart
  - Context saving needs

### 💻 5.8.2 Operating System Issues

#### 🖥️ Display
- **Major energy drain**
- OS can **turn off screen** after inactivity
- Regenerates quickly → considered a **sleep state**

#### 💽 Hard Disk
- Needs energy to keep spinning
- **Spin-down → Hibernate** (slow restart, high energy to spin-up)
- OS uses **break-even time (Td)** to decide when to stop disk
- Disk caching + program awareness helps avoid unnecessary restarts

#### 🧠 CPU
- **Idle → sleep** (await interrupt)
- **Dynamic voltage scaling**: reduces voltage + clock = big power savings
- Ex: Run at half speed → finish task in same time with ¼ power

##### 🔃 P-states & C-states
- **C-states** = sleep levels (C0 = active, C1–C4 = deeper sleeps)
- **P-states** = active modes with reduced voltage & frequency
- Example: P0 (3.6GHz/1.4V) → P3 (2.8GHz/1.2V)
- OS or CPU can control transitions

> Insight: Slower cores may improve **power + performance**, e.g., for network stack polling

#### 🧠 Memory
- Options:
  - **Sleep**: Flush + turn off cache
  - **Hibernate**: Write RAM to disk, power off completely
- Requires **ROM execution** or CPU restart to restore

#### 📡 Wireless Communication
- Radios are power-hungry if always listening
- **Solution** (Kravets & Krishnan):
  - Client sends sleep signal to base station
  - Base buffers incoming data
  - Client wakes, fetches buffered data
- Similar strategy in **802.11 WiFi** with beacon frames

#### 🌡️ Thermal Management
- Monitors CPU temperature
- **Fan vs. performance throttling**:
  - Fan = noise + power
  - Throttling = screen dim, slower CPU, spin down disk

#### 🔋 Battery Management
- Modern devices use **smart batteries**
  - Report voltage, charge, drain rate, etc.
- Multiple batteries → OS manages **failover**
- Final shutdown = OS ensures file system is safely flushed

#### 🧩 Driver Interface
- **ACPI**: OS queries driver capabilities
- OS sends:
  - Power reduction commands
  - Wakeup commands on user input (e.g., key/mouse)

## 🔌 5.8.3 Application Program Issues

### 🧩 The Role of Applications in Power Management

- The OS can **reduce power** through hardware controls, but:
  > Apps can **proactively reduce energy use** by **self-degrading** under low battery conditions.

- Trigger: Battery charge **falls below threshold**  
  → Apps **choose**:
  - Maintain performance (risk battery death)
  - Reduce quality (extend battery life)

---

### 🎥 Example: Video Player

When on low power, the app might:
- ⬛ **Drop color**: Show in **grayscale** to reduce processing load
- 🐢 **Reduce frame rate**: From 30 fps → 15 or lower (saves decoding & rendering effort)
- 🔳 **Lower resolution**: Fewer pixels = less GPU/CPU usage

> ⚡ These strategies **can save ~30% energy** at the cost of UX degradation

---

### ☁️ Local vs. Cloud Offloading

- Option: Offload compute-heavy tasks to **cloud servers** to save local energy.
- Trade-offs:
  - ✅ Saves CPU energy
  - ⚠️ Costs energy in **wireless transmission**
  - ⚠️ Adds **latency** (UX delay)
  - ⚠️ Introduces **security risks** and **dependency on connectivity**

---

### 🧠 Designing Power-Aware Applications

- Requires **intentional app design** with **battery-aware behavior**
- Particularly valuable for **mobile and embedded systems**
- Techniques include:
  - Adaptive quality control
  - Efficient buffering
  - Conditional feature activation

> **Takeaway**: Energy-aware applications **extend device usage time** at the cost of **minimal, controlled degradation**
