Clocks (or **timers**) are essential for timekeeping, CPU scheduling, profiling, watchdogs, and enforcing execution limits.

### 🛠️ 5.5.1 Clock Hardware

#### 🧱 Types of Clocks
- **Power-line clocks**: Trigger interrupts every cycle (50/60 Hz); now obsolete.
- **Programmable clocks**:
  - Built using a **crystal oscillator**, **counter**, and **holding register**.
  - Frequency derived from oscillator (hundreds of MHz to GHz).
  - Counter decrements on each pulse; when it reaches 0 → triggers **interrupt**.

#### ⏲️ Clock Modes
- **One-shot mode**: Interrupt occurs once after timer runs down.
- **Square-wave (periodic) mode**: Timer reloads automatically after each interrupt (used for clock ticks).
- **Programmability**: Interrupt interval can be fine-tuned via counter & register values.
- Typical chips have **2–3 independent programmable timers**.

#### 🔋 Backup Clock
- Battery-powered real-time clock maintains time across power cycles.
- On boot:
  - If RTC exists → read it.
  - If not → prompt user or use network sync.
- Timestamps typically counted as ticks since:
  - **UNIX**: Jan 1, 1970
  - **Windows**: Jan 1, 1980

---

### 🧠 5.5.2 Clock Software

Clocks generate interrupts; everything else is managed by the **clock driver** in software.

#### 🔄 Responsibilities of the Clock Driver

1. **Maintaining Time of Day**
   - Increment counter on each tick.
   - Store time in:
     - 64-bit ticks
     - Seconds + tick counter
     - Boot time + uptime ticks (see Fig. 5-28)

2. **CPU Scheduling / Quantum Expiry**
   - Each process gets a **tick quota**.
   - At each tick, the quota is decremented.
   - When quota = 0 → context switch triggered.

3. **CPU Usage Accounting**
   - **Accurate**: Start/stop a dedicated timer on each context switch.
   - **Simple**: Charge ticks to `current_process` in global pointer.
     - ⚠️ Includes ticks spent handling interrupts.

4. **Alarm System Calls (User-level Timers)**
   - User sets timer; expects signal/message when it expires.
   - Implemented using:
     - **Table of alarms**, or
     - **Sorted linked list of alarms**, using relative ticks (see Fig. 5-29).
   - On each tick:
     - Decrement countdown
     - Trigger signal when countdown reaches 0

5. **Watchdog Timers (Kernel-Level)**
   - Used internally to detect hangs or faults.
   - If watchdog isn't reset periodically → trigger recovery.
   - Implemented like alarms, but **call procedure** instead of sending signal.

6. **Profiling and Statistics**
   - Tick-based sampling of the **program counter** (PC).
   - Builds histogram of execution hotspots.
   - Can profile both **user** and **kernel** code.

---

### 🧮 Key Data Structures and Techniques

#### ⏳ Simulating Multiple Timers
- Use a **linked list** of pending timers sorted by trigger time.
- Each entry stores:
  - Relative tick delay from previous
  - Callback or signal info
- Decrement topmost entry on every tick
- Trigger event when delay = 0 and pop it from list

#### 📊 Profiling
- On each tick:
  - If profiling is enabled, map PC to bin
  - Increment that bin
- Helps visualize where a program spends most time

### 📌 Summary: Why Clocks Matter

| Function                    | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Time of Day                | Tracks real time with tick counter |
| Scheduling                 | Enforces process quanta |
| CPU Accounting             | Measures process CPU usage |
| User Alarms                | Supports signal-after-delay requests |
| Watchdogs                 | Detects hangs or stalls |
| Profiling                 | Builds execution histograms |

## 🧪 5.5.3 Soft Timers

Soft timers offer an efficient alternative to hardware timers for high-frequency, application-specific timing tasks.

---

### 🔁 Motivation
- **Interrupts**: Low latency but high CPU overhead due to context switches and pipeline disruption.
- **Polling**: No overhead but poor latency (average = half polling interval).
- **Problem**: Neither polling nor interrupts are optimal for ultra-frequent timer events.

---

### 🧠 Soft Timer Strategy (Aron & Druschel, 1999)
- Kernel checks **soft timer expiry** whenever it is **about to return to user mode**.
- If a timer has expired:
  - Execute the associated task **while still in kernel mode**.
  - **Reset** the soft timer using current clock value + timeout interval.

---

### 🔄 Events That Trigger Kernel Entry (Soft Timer Checkpoints)
1. System calls
2. TLB misses
3. Page faults
4. I/O interrupts
5. CPU going idle

---

### ⚙️ Performance Insights
- Real-world kernel entry rate: 2–18 μs across various workloads.
- Enables soft timers with ≈10 μs resolution (good enough for many cases).
- Minor deadlines may be missed, but avoids wasting ~35% CPU on interrupts.

---

### 🛡️ Backup: Secondary Hardware Timer
- To **bound delays**, a second hardware timer can be set (e.g., 1ms interval).
- Allows fallback to 1000 activations/sec during idle periods with no kernel entries.

## 💻 5.6 USER INTERFACES: KEYBOARD, MOUSE, & MONITOR

Focuses on how keyboards, mice, and monitors interact with software and the OS.

---

### 🖥️ 5.6.1 Input Software

#### ⌨️ Keyboard Hardware Overview
- Modern keyboards have **embedded microprocessors**.
- Commonly connected over **USB** or **Bluetooth**.
- In the past: serial port keyboards generated a **hardware interrupt** on both keypress and release.

---

#### 🔌 USB Keyboard Communication

##### 🎯 USB Transfers
- Uses **"interrupt transfer"** type of **stream pipe**.
- Despite the name, **host controller polls** the keyboard periodically.
- Polling interval configurable (e.g., 125μs to 4s on USB 2.0).

##### 🗃️ USB Reports
- Up to 8 bytes per report:
  - Byte 1: Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, etc.)
  - Byte 2: Reserved
  - Bytes 3–8: Scancodes of currently pressed keys (max 6 keys)

##### 🧠 Encoding Logic
- Earlier keypresses appear in **left-most scancode bytes**.
- On release: scancode removed, others shift left.

📊 **Example (Fig. 5-30)**:
| Step | Keys Pressed | Scancodes (Bytes 3–8)          |
|------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | H            | 0b                             |
| 2    | H, J         | 0b 0d                          |
| 3    | H, J, B      | 0b 0d 05                       |
| 4    | H, B         | 0b 05                          |
| 5    | H, B, O      | 0b 05 12                       |

---

#### 🧾 USB Interrupt Mechanism
- After polling and receiving a report:
  - **Host controller generates a hardware interrupt** to notify CPU.
  - **Keyboard driver** extracts data and updates internal state.

---

#### 🖥️ Terminal-Like Interfaces
- Typing in **command-line shells** is a core interaction model for many systems.
- Even modern keyboard input flows through these mechanisms before being processed by shells or GUIs.

---
## ⌨️ 5.6.1 Keyboard Software

This section explores how keyboards interact with the OS, including scan code processing, input modes, echoing, buffering, and handling of special control characters.

---

### 🧬 Scan Codes vs ASCII
- USB keyboards send **scan codes**, not ASCII values.
  - E.g., Key `A` sends scan code `4`.
- **Driver's job**: interpret modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) to resolve to correct ASCII or control command.

---

### 🧠 Driver Philosophies
There are two main approaches to keyboard input handling:

| Mode            | Philosophy         | Characteristics                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw Mode**    | Character-oriented | Driver passes ASCII stream (with backspaces etc.) to user program               |
| **Cooked Mode** | Line-oriented      | Driver performs in-line editing, delivers clean line to user program            |

- POSIX terms:
  - **Canonical mode** = Cooked
  - **Noncanonical mode** = Raw

---

### 🧱 Input Buffering
- Required in both modes:
  - **Cooked mode**: store line for editing.
  - **Raw mode**: allow **type-ahead** before program reads.
- Buffers can be **dedicated or dynamic**.
  - Dynamic allows for unlimited type-ahead, avoiding poor UX.

---

### 🔁 Echoing
- User expects typed input to appear on screen.
- Issues:
  - **Concurrency**: program output might clash with echo.
  - **Line wrapping**: long lines may wrap or get truncated (e.g., at 80 chars).
  - **Tab handling**: driver calculates cursor position and expands tabs accordingly.

---

### ↩️ Carriage Return vs Line Feed
- OS uses a **standard format**, while keyboards/monitors vary.
- Driver translates:
  - **UNIX**: Enter = line feed (`\n`)
  - **Windows**: Enter = carriage return + line feed (`\r\n`)
- Driver handles correct echo behavior per terminal type.

---

### ⚙️ Canonical Mode Special Characters (POSIX)

| Key        | Name   | Purpose                                           |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Ctrl-H`   | ERASE  | Delete previous character                        |
| `Ctrl-U`   | KILL   | Delete entire input line                         |
| `Ctrl-V`   | LNEXT  | Insert next character literally (escape char)    |
| `Ctrl-S`   | STOP   | Pause screen output                              |
| `Ctrl-Q`   | START  | Resume screen output                             |
| `DEL`      | INTR   | Send SIGINT (interrupt process)                  |
| `Ctrl-\`   | QUIT   | Send SIGQUIT (core dump)                         |
| `Ctrl-D`   | EOF    | End-of-file (empty buffer read returns 0 bytes)  |
| `Ctrl-M`   | CR     | Carriage Return (non-configurable)               |
| `Ctrl-J`   | NL     | Line Feed (non-configurable)                     |

---

### ✂️ ERASE & KILL Behavior
- **ERASE (Backspace)**:
  - Removes previous char from buffer.
  - Echo: backspace + space + backspace.
- **KILL**:
  - Deletes entire line.
  - May either clear display or print old line + newline.

---

### 🧷 Escaping Special Characters
- **LNEXT (Ctrl-V)** allows inputting special chars literally.
  - E.g., to type `@` if it's bound to KILL, use `Ctrl-V @`.
  - Double `Ctrl-V` to input a literal `Ctrl-V`.

---

### 🧊 Freezing Output: Flow Control
- **Ctrl-S**: STOP output (sets a flag, suppresses echoing too).
- **Ctrl-Q**: START output (clears flag).

---

### 🧨 Process Signals
- **INTR (DEL / Ctrl-C)**: Sends `SIGINT` to user’s processes.
- **QUIT (Ctrl-\)**: Sends `SIGQUIT`, generates core dump.
- After either:
  - Echo newline
  - Discard pending input for a fresh start.

> Handling these keys must be careful on multiuser systems to signal only the correct user's processes.

---

### 🛑 EOF (Ctrl-D)
- Causes current buffer to be read (even if empty).
- At start of a line: interpreted as end-of-file (returns 0 bytes).

---
## 🖱️ 5.6.2 Mouse & Trackpad Software

This section explains how the OS interacts with **mice** and **trackpads**, their input formats, sensing technologies, and common use patterns in GUIs.

---
### 🖱️ Mouse Input

- **Trigger Events**: Mouse sends data when:
  - Moved by a **minimum distance** (~0.1 mm, called a *mickey*)
  - Button is **pressed or released**

- **Data Sent to OS**:
  ```
  Δx, Δy, button_state
  ```
  - Δx and Δy: Movement delta since last report
  - `button_state`: Current status of all mouse buttons

- **Report Rate**: Up to **40 reports/sec**
  - Multiple movements may accumulate between reports

- **Mouse Characteristics**:
  - Number of buttons: 1–3 (or more with modern gaming mice)
  - Optional: scroll wheels (act as extra input channels)
  - Wireless mice use **Bluetooth** or similar radios instead of wires

- **Relative Positioning**:
  - Mice report **relative motion**, *not* absolute coordinates
  - Picking up and repositioning the mouse sends **no event**

- **Double Click Detection**:
  - Defined by software via two thresholds:
    - **Time window** (ms)
    - **Distance window** (mickeys)
  - Both thresholds are often user-configurable

---
### 🖲️ Trackpad (Touchpad) Input

Used in laptops as a mouse replacement. Trackpads may or may not have physical buttons.

#### ✍️ Types of Trackpad Technologies:

| Type         | Detection Mechanism                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conductive** | Uses two perpendicular wire grids separated by an insulator. Pressure brings them closer, causing detectable current flow at touch points |
| **Capacitive** | Measures local capacitance changes caused by **human touch**. Most modern trackpads use this. Pens/plastic do not work. |

- **Capacitive Trackpads**:
  - Continuously charge/discharge capacitors
  - Touch increases **local capacitance** → determines coordinates
  - Sensitive only to **conductive objects** (like fingers or tongues 😅)

- **Touch Pressure**:
  - Some trackpads (e.g., MacBooks) detect force and **simulate clicks** via pressure

---

### 🧪 Fun Fact
> "Licking your trackpad should move the cursor, because tongues have capacitance."
