## 4.1 Processors

The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is the brain of a computer, responsible for fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them in a repetitive cycle until the program completes.
### Instruction Execution Cycle

The basic operation cycle of the CPU involves:

1. **Fetching:** Retrieving the next instruction from memory.
2. **Decoding:** Interpreting the instruction type and operands.
3. **Executing:** Performing the required operation.

Each CPU has a specific **instruction set**, meaning an **x86 processor** cannot execute programs designed for an **ARM processor**, and vice versa. The term **x86** refers to Intel processors originating from the 8088, including the 286, 386, Pentium series, and modern Intel Core processors (i3, i5, i7).

### CPU Registers

Since memory access is slower than instruction execution, CPUs use **registers** to store key variables and temporary results. Key types of registers include:

1. **General-purpose registers:** Hold variables and temporary data.
2. **Special-purpose registers:** Directly accessible to programmers, such as:
    - **Program Counter (PC):** Holds the address of the next instruction to fetch.
    - **Stack Pointer (SP):** Points to the top of the stack, storing function call data (input parameters, local variables).
    - **Program Status Word (PSW):** Contains important status information, including condition codes (set by comparison instructions), CPU priority, user/kernel mode, and control bits.

The OS must manage these registers carefully when **switching between processes**, saving their state to resume execution later.

### Architecture vs. Micro-architecture

- **Architecture:** The CPU’s visible aspects, including its instruction set and registers.
- **Micro-architecture:** The underlying implementation details, such as caches, branch predictors, and pipeline stages, which are not directly visible to software.

### Pipelining

To improve performance, modern CPUs abandon the traditional fetch-decode-execute cycle and instead use **pipelining**, where different stages of instruction execution overlap.

For example, in a **three-stage pipeline**, while instruction `n` is being executed:

- Instruction `n + 1` is being decoded.
- Instruction `n + 2` is being fetched.

Pipelining increases throughput but introduces complexity, especially with **conditional branching**, as all fetched instructions must be executed.

---
### Superscalar Architecture

A more advanced concept is **superscalar CPUs**, where multiple execution units handle different types of operations in parallel, such as:

- Integer arithmetic
- Floating-point calculations
- Boolean operations

Instructions are fetched and placed in a **holding buffer**, allowing parallel execution based on available resources. This results in **out-of-order execution**, where instructions may not be processed sequentially but must produce the correct final result.

### Kernel Mode vs. User Mode

Most CPUs have at least two operating modes:

1. **Kernel Mode:**
    - Grants full access to all CPU instructions and hardware features.
    - The OS runs in kernel mode to control system resources.
2. **User Mode:**
    - Restricts access to critical hardware functions to protect system integrity.
    - Regular applications operate in this mode, relying on the OS for privileged operations.

In desktop, notebook, and server systems, the OS primarily runs in kernel mode, whereas in embedded systems, only a small core runs in kernel mode, with most processes in user mode.

### Moore's Law
states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months. This ‘‘law’’ is not some kind of law of physics, like conservation of momentum, but is an observation by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore of how fast process engineers at the semiconductor companies are able to shrink their transistors.

### Multi Threading
WIth increasing capacity the obvious next step is to replicate not only the functional units, but also some of the control logic. To a first approximation, what it does is allow the CPU to hold the state of two different threads and then switch back and forth on a nanosecond time scale.  For example, if one of the processes needs to read a word from memory (which takes many clock cycles), a multithreaded CPU can just switch to another thread. Multithreading does not offer true parallelism. Only one process at a time is running, but thread-switching time is reduced to the order of a nanosecond.

## 4.2 Memory

Ideally memory should be faster than the CPU so that retrieving things doesn't make the CPU wait, but with current technology that is not possible, so we follow a different way. we have hierarchy of layers, the top layers have higher speed, smaller capacity and greater cost per bit than the lower ones.

Registers are made of up of same material as the CPU so they are very fast but very costly, The storage capacity available in them is on the order of 32 × 32 bits on a 32-bit CPU and 64 × 64 bits on a 64-bit CPU. Less than 1 KB in both cases. Programs must manage the registers (i.e., decide what to keep in them) themselves, in software.
Next comes the cache memory, which is mostly controlled by the hardware. Main memory is divided up into cache lines, typically 64 bytes, with addresses 0 to 63 in cache line 0, 64 to 127 in cache line 1, and so on. The most heavily used cache lines are kept in a high-speed cache located inside or very close to the CPU. When the program needs to read a memory word, the cache hardware checks to see if the line needed is in the cache. If it is, called a cache hit, the request is satisfied from the cache and no memory request is sent over the bus to the main memory.

In any caching system, several questions come up fairly soon, including:
1. When to put a new item into the cache.
2. Which cache line to put the new item in.
3. Which item to remove from the cache when a slot is needed.
4. Where to put a newly evicted item in the larger memory.

There is one more kind of memory called CMOS memory which holds the current time and date. The CMOS memory and the clock circuit that increments time in it are powred by a small battery, so the time is correctly updated even when the computer is turned off. CMOS is used because it draws so little power that the original factory-installed battery often lasts for several years. However, when it begins to fail, the computer can appear to be losing its marbles, forgetting things that it has known for years, like how to boot.

## 4.3 I/O Devices

Along with secondary memory there are various other io devices in a computer. Usually an IO device consists of two parts, a controller and the device itself. The controller is a chip that physically controls the device. It accepts commands from the OS for example to read data from the device and carries them out. In many cases, the actual control of the device is complicated and detailed, so it is the job of the controller to present a simpler (but still very complex) interface to the operating system.

SATA stands for Standard ATA and ATA stands for AT Attachment. AT was IBM's second generation "Personal computer Advanced Technology". Because each type of controller is different, different software is needed to control each one. The software that talks to a controller, giving it commands and accepting responses, is called a device driver. Each controller manufacturer has to supply a driver for each operating system it supports. Thus a scanner may come with drivers for macOS, Windows 11, and Linux, for example. To be used, the driver has to be put into the operating system so it can run in kernel mode. Drivers can actually run outside the kernel, and operating systems like Linux and Windows nowadays do offer some support for doing so, but the vast
majority of the drivers still run below the kernel boundary. Only very few current systems, such as MINIX 3 run all drivers in user space. Drivers in user space must be allowed to access the device in a controlled way, which is not straightforward without some hardware support.
