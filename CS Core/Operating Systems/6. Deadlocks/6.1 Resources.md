### üß© Introduction

- **Deadlocks** arise when processes compete for **exclusive resources** and end up **blocking each other indefinitely**.
- Common causes:
  - Multiple processes need **multiple resources** simultaneously.
  - If each acquires one and waits for another held by the other, deadlock can occur.
- **Examples**:
  - A 3D scanner and a printer used in different orders by two processes.
  - Shared office devices (e.g., printers, tape drives) over networks.
  - Databases where record locks can cause circular wait chains.

### üîß 6.1 Resources

- **Resource**: Anything that must be *acquired, used, and released*.
  - Could be **hardware** (printer, camera) or **software** (file, DB record).
  - May have **multiple instances** (e.g., multiple printers).

### üõ†Ô∏è 6.1.1 Preemptable vs Nonpreemptable Resources

| Type              | Description                                                                 | Example             | Handling Deadlocks           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Preemptable**   | Can be forcibly reclaimed **without harm**                                  | Memory               | Can be **reallocated**        |
| **Nonpreemptable**| Cannot be forcibly taken without risk of **corruption or failure**          | Printer, 3D scanner  | Requires **careful handling** |

- Most **deadlocks involve nonpreemptable resources**.
- Preemptable resources can typically be **swapped out or reassigned** to avoid deadlock.

---

### üîÅ Standard Resource Usage Cycle

1. **Request** the resource
2. **Use** the resource
3. **Release** the resource

- If a resource is **unavailable**:
  - Process is **blocked** or sleeps and **retries** later.
  - The behavior depends on the **operating system's design**.

### üßµ Deadlock Conditions (coming up next...)

- The text introduces deadlocks conceptually here, with formal conditions and solutions to be covered in the following sections.

---
### 1.2 Resource Acquisition

### üéõÔ∏è Using Semaphores for Resource Management

- Each **resource** (e.g., database record) can be protected with a **semaphore** (or a mutex).
- For **one resource**:
  ```c
  down(&resource1);
  use resource1();
  up(&resource1);
  ```
- For **two or more resources**, acquire them **sequentially**:
  ```c
  down(&resource1);
  down(&resource2);
  use both();
  up(&resource2);
  up(&resource1);
  ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlock vs No Deadlock

- **Deadlock-Free**:
  - All processes **acquire resources in the same order**.
- **Potential Deadlock**:
  - Processes **acquire in different orders**, causing circular wait.
  - Example: A locks resource1 ‚Üí B locks resource2 ‚Üí both wait for the other's lock ‚Üí deadlock.

> Small differences in acquisition order can cause hard-to-detect deadlocks.

## üçù 6.1.3 The Dining Philosophers Problem

### üß† Problem Setup

- Five philosophers sit at a round table.
- Each needs **2 forks** to eat spaghetti.
- **One fork between each pair**; each philosopher picks up **left and right forks** to eat.

### üîÅ Philosopher Lifecycle

```c
while (TRUE) {
  think();
  take_fork(i);
  take_fork((i+1) % N);
  eat();
  put_fork(i);
  put_fork((i+1) % N);
}
```

> ‚ùå **This naive solution leads to deadlock** if all philosophers pick up their left forks at the same time.

---

### üåÄ Starvation

- **Starvation**: A situation where all processes run indefinitely but make **no progress**.
- Can occur if philosophers **simultaneously back off and retry** in lockstep.

---

### ‚úÖ Deadlock-Free + Starvation-Free Solution

- Use:
  - `state[i]`: to track whether philosopher i is THINKING, HUNGRY, or EATING.
  - `mutex`: binary semaphore for mutual exclusion.
  - `s[i]`: semaphore for philosopher i to wait for forks.

```c
take_forks(i) {
  down(&mutex);
  state[i] = HUNGRY;
  test(i);
  up(&mutex);
  down(&s[i]);
}

put_forks(i) {
  down(&mutex);
  state[i] = THINKING;
  test(LEFT);
  test(RIGHT);
  up(&mutex);
}

test(i) {
  if (state[i] == HUNGRY &&
      state[LEFT] != EATING &&
      state[RIGHT] != EATING) {
    state[i] = EATING;
    up(&s[i]);
  }
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Characteristics of the Solution

- **Deadlock-free** ‚úÖ
- **Allows maximum parallelism** (non-adjacent philosophers can eat simultaneously).
- **Starvation-free** (progress guaranteed if neighbors are not eating).

---

### üí¨ Real-World Insight

- Dining philosophers is a **classic abstraction**.
- The logic applies to real problems in **resource allocation**, **thread coordination**, and **deadlock handling**.
- Efficient deadlock handling is critical in **operating systems**, **DBMS**, and **distributed systems**.
