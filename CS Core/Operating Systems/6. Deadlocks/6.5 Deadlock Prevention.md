> **Core Idea:**  
If even one of the four Coffman conditions is denied, **deadlock becomes structurally impossible**.

### 🔁 6.6.1 Attacking the Mutual-Exclusion Condition

- **Goal:** Avoid exclusive ownership of resources.
- ✅ *Possible for* read-only data → concurrent access is safe.
- ❌ *Not viable for* devices like printers or scanners (must be exclusive).
  
#### ✅ Real-world strategy:
- **Spooling (e.g., printers):**  
  - Multiple processes write output to disk.
  - **Only the printer daemon** interacts with the actual printer.
  - Eliminates printer deadlock (but may cause disk space deadlock).

#### ⚠️ Caveat:
- If spooling space fills up mid-job (e.g., both jobs occupy half space), and no one can finish — → **disk deadlock**.

---

### 🧶 6.6.2 Attacking the Hold-and-Wait Condition

- **Strategy 1:** Request all resources at once before execution starts.
  - ✅ Deadlocks avoided
  - ❌ Resources are underutilized.
  - ❌ Impractical when resource needs are dynamic or unknown.

- **Strategy 2:** Release all resources before requesting a new one.
  - ❌ High overhead, breaks logical atomicity.

#### 🔍 Example (I/O job):
- Needs input tape, runs computation, then needs output tape & plotter.
- Holding output resources during long compute → **wastes capacity**.

---

### 🚫 6.6.3 Attacking the No-Preemption Condition

- **Idea:** Forcefully reclaim resources when deadlock risk arises.

- ✅ Virtualize certain devices (e.g., printers via spooling).
- ❌ Not feasible for all resources:
  - Cannot preempt **critical sections** or **locked database rows**.

#### 🔁 Spooling helps, but not for:
- In-memory locks
- Shared tables
- Active resource states

---

### 🔄 6.6.4 Attacking the Circular-Wait Condition

- **Option 1:** Restrict to 1 resource per process at a time  
  - ❌ Impractical for many real workflows

- **Option 2:** Impose a **global ordering** on resources:
  - Processes may **only request higher-numbered resources**.
  - **Deadlocks are provably impossible** because cycles can't form.

#### 🧠 Key Insight:
> If a process holds resource `i`, it cannot request resource `j` where `j < i`.

### 🧾 Recap: Coffman Conditions & Prevention Tactics

| Condition            | Prevention Strategy                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Mutual Exclusion     | Spool everything (where possible)  |
| Hold and Wait        | Request all resources upfront      |
| No Preemption        | Force resource revocation          |
| Circular Wait        | Order resources numerically        |

---

### ⚠️ Practicality Check

- Prevention is often **too rigid** or **resource-wasteful**.
- OSes often combine **partial prevention + detection + heuristics**.
