 Goals:

- Master process management, memory systems, file systems, virtualization, and concurrency at a deep theoretical and practical level.

**Topics to Cover Deeply:**

1. **Processes & Threads:**
    - Process scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, MLFQ)
    - Context switching & kernel vs. user mode
    - Process synchronization (mutex, semaphore, condition variables)
2. **Memory Management:**
    - Paging, segmentation, TLBs
    - Virtual memory, swapping, thrashing
    - Deep dive into memory allocation strategies (buddy system, slab allocation)
3. Concurrency:
    - Race conditions, deadlocks, livelocks
    - Monitors, spinlocks, atomic operations
    - Deep-dive into multithreading internals (Pthreads, Linux Kernel Threads)
4. **File Systems:**
    - Journaling vs. Non-journaling
    - In-depth study of EXT4, NTFS, ZFS
    - I/O scheduling and disk caching techniques
5. **Virtualization & Containers:**
    - Deep-dive into hypervisors (Type-1 vs Type-2)
    - Namespaces, cgroups (used in Docker)
    - Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM), Xen, VMware

- Book: "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" by Remzi Arpaci
- MIT OpenCourseWare: Operating Systems
- Practical: Linux kernel internals (play around with `procfs`, scheduling policies)
