A **system call** is a mechanism that allows user programs to request services from the operating system. The book primarily discusses **UNIX-based system calls**, though the concepts are broadly applicable across different operating systems, with variations in exact parameters and implementations.

### System Calls and User Programs

- A **single-CPU system** can execute only **one instruction at a time**.
- If a user-mode process requires an OS service (e.g., reading a file), it must execute a **trap instruction** to switch to **kernel mode** and invoke the system call.
- The OS identifies the request, executes the necessary operations, and **returns control** to the next instruction in the user program.
- Conceptually, a system call is similar to a **procedure call**, but unlike regular function calls, it enters the **kernel**.

### Example: The `read` System Call

A system call can be invoked in a **C program** using a wrapper function provided by the system’s standard library:

c

CopyEdit

`count = read(fd, buffer, nbytes);`

- **Parameters**:
    - `fd` (File Descriptor): Specifies the file to read from.
    - `buffer`: Points to a memory location where data should be stored.
    - `nbytes`: Specifies the number of bytes to read.

### Steps in Executing a System Call

#### **Step 1–3: Preparing Parameters**

- Before calling the system call, parameters are stored in **CPU registers** (e.g., RDI, RSI, RDX for x86-64 systems using System V AMD64 ABI).
- The **first and third parameters** are passed **by value**, while the **second (buffer)** is passed **by reference**.

#### **Step 4–6: Transition to Kernel Mode**

- The user program calls a **library function** (`read`), which:
    - Stores the **system-call number** in a predefined register (e.g., RAX in x86-64).
    - Executes a **trap instruction** (e.g., `SYSCALL` in x86-64), switching to **kernel mode** and jumping to a fixed entry point in the OS kernel.

#### **Step 7–8: System Call Execution**

- The **kernel** reads the system-call number from RAX and uses a **table of system-call handlers** to locate the appropriate function.
- The OS executes the system-call handler, performing the requested operation (e.g., reading data from a file into the buffer).

#### **Step 9–11: Returning to User Mode**

- After execution, control is **returned** to the user-space library procedure, which then returns to the user program.
- The program resumes execution from the **next instruction** after the system call.

### Blocking in System Calls

- If the system call **cannot proceed immediately** (e.g., waiting for user input from the keyboard), the OS **blocks** the process and switches to another runnable process.
- Once the required input is available, the OS resumes the blocked process and completes execution.

---

### Key Takeaways

- System calls enable user programs to request **privileged operations** from the OS.
- The transition from user mode to **kernel mode** is performed using a **trap instruction**.
- A **system-call table** maps system-call numbers to their respective handlers.
- **Blocking** may occur when waiting for resources, allowing efficient CPU utilization.

### System calls for process management

Fork is the only way to create a new process in POSIX. It creates an exact duplicate of the original process, including all the file descriptors, registers everything. All the variables have identical values at the time of the fork, but since the values are copied to create the child, modification of these variables in process do not affect the other. In the beginning both processes share the same variables but when a change is made to any of those a new copy is created. This way copying the variables is minimized at the beginning of process creation. 

The fork call returns a value which is 0 in the child and a value equal to the child PID (Process Identifier) in the parent. Using this pid we can determine which is parent and which is child. For example in a shell when a user enters a command, a process is created using fork and then the parent process that is the shell will wait for the command to finish executing using the Waitpid system call. When waitpid completes, the address
pointed to by the second parameter, statloc, will be set to the child process’ exit
status (normal or abnormal termination and exit value). Various options are also
provided, specified by the third parameter. For example, returning immediately if
no child has already exited.

Proccesses in UNIX have their memory divided up into three segments: the text segment i.e the program code, the data segment i.e the variables and the stack segment. The data segment grows upward and the stack grows downward as show in figure below. Between them is a gap of unused addres space. The stack grows automatically as required but expansion of the data segment is
done explicitly by using a system call, br k, which specifies the new address where
the data segment is to end. This call, however, is not defined by the POSIX standard,
since programmers are encouraged to use the malloc library procedure for
dynamically allocating storage, and the underlying implementation of malloc was
not thought to be a suitable subject for standardization since few programmers use
it directly and it is doubtful that anyone even notices that br k is not in POSIX.

### System Calls for File and Directory Management

#### **File Management System Calls**

- **open()** – Opens a file (read, write, or both). `O_CREAT` is used to create new files.
- **close()** – Releases a file descriptor for reuse.
- **read() / write()** – Reads from or writes to an open file.
- **lseek()** – Moves the file pointer for random access.
- **stat() / fstat()** – Retrieves file metadata (size, type, modification time).

#### **Directory Management System Calls**

- **mkdir() / rmdir()** – Creates or removes a directory.
- **link() / unlink()** – Creates a new name for an existing file; unlink removes it.
- **mount() / umount()** – Merges or detaches file systems into a single hierarchy.

---

### **Miscellaneous System Calls**

- **chdir()** – Changes the working directory.
- **chmod()** – Modifies file permissions.
- **kill()** – Sends signals to processes.
- **time()** – Returns the current system time (UNIX epoch: Jan 1, 1970).

### **The Windows API**

Windows and UNIX differ fundamentally in their **programming models**:

- **UNIX programs** execute **system calls** directly to request OS services.
- **Windows programs** follow an **event-driven model**, where the main program waits for user interactions (e.g., key presses, mouse movements) and then calls event-handling procedures.

---
### **Windows API vs. UNIX System Calls**

Windows follows an **event-driven model**, unlike UNIX, which uses **direct system calls**.  
Windows system calls are abstracted through the **Win32 API**, allowing backward compatibility but making it difficult to distinguish system calls from user-space calls.

#### **Windows API Equivalents**

| UNIX System Call | Windows API Equivalent  | Description                                      |

| `mkdir()`        | `CreateDirectory()`     | Creates a directory                              |
| `rmdir()`        | `RemoveDirectory()`     | Removes an empty directory                       |
| `unlink()`       | `DeleteFile()`          | Deletes a file                                   |
| `chdir()`        | `SetCurrentDirectory()` | Changes the working directory                    |
| `time()`         | `GetLocalTime()`        | Retrieves system time                            |

#### **Key Differences**

- Windows lacks **file links**, **mounting**, and **signals**, unlike UNIX.
- Windows provides **thousands of API calls**, with many executed entirely in **user space**.
- The **Win32 API** is inconsistent due to backward compatibility with older Windows versions.

**Takeaway:** UNIX system calls are directly exposed, while Windows relies on an abstraction layer, making system behavior more flexible but less transparent.
