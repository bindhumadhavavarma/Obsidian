Now lets look into how the insides of an operating systems work. In the book there are 6 different types that will be discussed namely, monolithic systems, layered systems, microkernels, client-
server systems, virtual machines, and exo- and unikernels.


### **8.1 Monolithic Systems**

In a **monolithic system**, the entire operating system runs as a **single program** in **kernel mode**, consisting of numerous interdependent procedures.

#### **Characteristics**:

- All **OS procedures** are compiled and linked into a **single large executable**.
- **No module isolation**—any procedure can call any other, making it **efficient** but **hard to manage**.
- **A single crash** in any procedure can bring down the entire OS.

#### **Basic Structure**:

1. A **main program** that handles service requests.
2. **Service procedures** that execute system calls.
3. **Utility procedures** that assist service procedures.

While monolithic systems are fast and efficient, their lack of modularity makes them **complex and error-prone**.

---

###  8.2 **Layered Systems**

Layered operating systems **structure the OS into hierarchical layers**, each **built on top of the previous one**.

#### **THE System (First Layered OS - 1968)**

Developed by **E. W. Dijkstra**, the **THE system** had **six layers**:

|Layer|Function|
|---|---|
|**5**|System operator process|
|**4**|User programs|
|**3**|I/O management & buffering|
|**2**|Process-to-operator communication|
|**1**|Memory & drum management|
|**0**|CPU scheduling & multiprogramming|

- **Layer 0** handled CPU scheduling and switching between processes.
- **Layer 1** managed memory, swapping pages between RAM and disk storage.
- **Layer 3** buffered I/O operations to simplify device interactions.
- **Higher layers** provided abstraction, so **user programs** didn’t need to manage processes, memory, or I/O manually.

#### **MULTICS and Ring-Based Protection**

- **MULTICS** introduced **concentric rings** instead of layers, where **inner rings had more privileges** than outer ones.
- **To call an inner ring**, a program had to **perform a system call (TRAP instruction)**, ensuring security by validating parameters.
- This model allowed **better runtime enforcement** compared to THE, where all layers were linked into a single executable.


### 8.3 **Microkernels**

Microkernels aim to **increase reliability** by keeping the **kernel minimal** and running most OS components as **user-mode processes**. Unlike monolithic systems, where the entire OS runs in **kernel mode**, microkernels contain only **essential functions**, such as:

- **Process scheduling**
- **Interprocess communication (IPC)**
- **Basic memory management**

All other components, including **device drivers and file systems**, run as **user-mode processes**.

---

### **Advantages of Microkernels**

1. **High reliability** – A bug in a driver crashes only that component, **not the entire OS**.
2. **Security and Isolation** – Processes have **restricted access** to resources, preventing unintended system modifications.
3. **Self-healing systems** – Faulty components (e.g., a crashing driver) can be **automatically restarted** without user intervention.
4. **Flexibility** – Different policies (e.g., scheduling) can be managed in user mode, keeping the **kernel simple**.

---

### **Microkernels in Use**

- **macOS** uses the **Mach microkernel**.
- **MINIX3**, a microkernel OS, is used by **Intel’s management engine** in CPUs.
    - **MINIX3 Kernel** (~15,000 lines of C, ~1400 lines of assembly)
    - Provides **40 kernel calls** for core operations like interrupt handling and memory management.

---

### **Microkernel Architecture**

1. **User-mode Device Drivers** – Drivers cannot directly access hardware. Instead, they **request I/O operations via kernel calls**.
2. **User-mode Servers** – Responsible for OS functions like file management and process control.
    - Example: A file read request is **sent to a file server**, which retrieves the data.
3. **Reincarnation Server** – Detects and **restarts failed processes**, ensuring system stability.

---

### **Security: POLA (Principle of Least Authority)**

- Each process has **only the permissions it needs** to perform its task, minimizing potential damage from bugs or security breaches.
- Example: A **file system process** can allow a **disk driver** to write to **specific memory addresses** but not modify arbitrary system data.

---

### **Mechanism vs. Policy Separation**

- **Mechanism**: The kernel provides the **basic functionality** (e.g., scheduling a process).
- **Policy**: User-mode processes determine **how** decisions are made (e.g., assigning process priorities).

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Microkernels **increase system reliability and security** by **minimizing the kernel**.
- OS components like **drivers and file systems** run in **user mode**, reducing system-wide failures.
- **Self-healing** capabilities allow automatic recovery from failures.
- **POLA ensures security** by restricting process privileges to the minimum necessary.
- **Separation of mechanism and policy** keeps the **kernel small and flexible**.

Microkernels trade **performance for modularity and reliability**, making them ideal for **mission-critical applications** like avionics, military, and industrial systems.


### 8.4 Client-Server Model

It is a slight variation to Microkernel idea, to distinguish two classes of processes, the servers each of which provides some service and the clients which use these services. This model is known as the client-server model. The essence is the presence of client processes and server processes.

Communication between clients and servers is often by message passing. To obtain a service, a client process constructs a message saying what it wants and sends it to the appropriate service. The service then does the work and sends back the answer. If the client and server happen to run on the same machine, certain optimizations are possible, but conceptually, we are still talking about message passing here.

Increasingly many systems involve users at their home PCs as clients and large machines elsewhere running as servers. In fact, much of the Web operates this way. A PC sends a request for a Web page to the server and the Web page comes back. This is a typical use of the client-server model in a network.

### 8.5 **Virtual Machines**

A **virtual machine (VM)** is a software-emulated environment that mimics a physical computer. The **IBM VM/370 system** introduced this concept, fundamentally changing how operating systems handle **multiprogramming and system isolation**.

---

### **Origin of Virtual Machines**

- **OS/360**, IBM’s early batch system, lacked interactive capabilities.
- IBM’s **official timesharing system (TSS/360)** was slow and impractical.
- **IBM’s Scientific Center in Cambridge** developed **VM/370**, which became widely adopted.
- Its successor, **z/VM**, powers **IBM zSeries mainframes**, used for enterprise computing.

---

### **Structure of VM/370**

- The **Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)** runs directly on **bare hardware** and manages **multiple virtual machines (VMs)**.
- Instead of offering an **extended machine** (like a traditional OS), VM/370 provided **exact hardware replicas**, including:
    - **Kernel/user mode**
    - **I/O handling**
    - **Interrupts and system calls**

Each **virtual machine behaves like an independent computer**, capable of running its own operating system.

---

### **How a Virtual Machine Operation Works**

![[{87D9A904-5FC7-441C-8B62-7DBD09E5337B}.png]]

When a user process inside a VM performs an operation, the **flow works as follows**:

1. The process inside the **CMS OS (Conversational Monitor System)** makes a **system call**.
2. The system call is **trapped within the CMS virtual machine**, just as if it were running on real hardware.
3. CMS executes **hardware I/O instructions** to handle the request.
4. These I/O instructions are **trapped by VM/370**, which intercepts and emulates real hardware behavior.
5. VM/370 executes the requested I/O operation (e.g., **reading from virtual disk**) and returns the result to CMS.
6. The CMS process receives the data and continues execution.

This **separation of system calls and hardware interaction** ensures **each VM remains isolated**, improving system **stability and security**.

---

### **Key Features of VM/370**

1. **Full Hardware Emulation**
    
    - Each VM behaves like a **real physical computer**, running its own **independent OS**.
    - Multiple **different operating systems** can run **simultaneously** on the same hardware.
2. **Independent System Calls & I/O**
    
    - System calls are **trapped and handled inside** the VM, rather than by the host OS.
    - The **VMM (VM/370) intercepts and executes I/O instructions** securely.
3. **Flexibility & Isolation**
    
    - Users could run **OS/360 for batch processing** while others ran **CMS for interactive tasks**.
    - If a **VM crashes, others remain unaffected**, preventing system-wide failures.

---

### **Modern Applications: z/VM**

- **IBM z/VM** now runs multiple **Linux instances** alongside **IBM’s proprietary OS**.
- Used in **enterprise data centers** for **server consolidation and high-availability computing**.


### 8.6 Exokernels and Unikernels

Exokernels and Unikernels are alternative approaches to system virtualization that focus on **direct resource allocation** and **minimalistic OS design**, respectively.

---

#### **Exokernels: Direct Resource Partitioning**

Instead of **cloning a machine** (as done in virtual machines), an **exokernel** partitions resources **among multiple virtual environments**.

- Each virtual machine gets a **subset** of resources (e.g., disk blocks, memory pages) instead of a fully virtualized system.
- The **Exokernel (a minimal kernel in kernel mode)** is responsible for:
    - Allocating resources.
    - **Enforcing isolation** by ensuring each VM **only accesses** its assigned resources.

#### **Advantages of Exokernels**

1. **No extra mapping overhead** – Unlike traditional VMs, the **exokernel doesn’t need to translate virtual disk addresses**, reducing complexity.
2. **Separation of multiprogramming from user OS code** – Similar to microkernels but with **lower overhead**.
3. **Custom OS environments** – Each VM can run **its own OS**, but only within the resources it has been allocated.

---

### **Unikernels: Minimalist OS Design**

- **Unikernels** emerged from the **LibOS (Library OS) concept**, where an OS is **linked directly with an application** to form a **self-contained unit**.
- A **unikernel contains only the OS functions needed by the specific application**, reducing bloat.

#### **How Unikernels Work**

- Instead of running **multiple processes**, a unikernel VM runs **a single application** in **kernel mode**.
- Since there is **no need for interprocess protection**, unikernels **eliminate the performance overhead** of traditional OS features like user/kernel mode transitions.

#### **Advantages of Unikernels**

1. **Highly efficient** – No need for process switching or unnecessary OS components.
2. **Better security** – The **attack surface is minimized** since there is only **one application**.
3. **Fast boot times** – Since only the required OS components are included, unikernels can start almost **instantly**.
