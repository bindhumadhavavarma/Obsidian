## **What is an Operating System (OS)?**

A modern computer consists of various hardware components such as processors, memory, storage devices, input/output peripherals, and network interfaces, forming a complex system. Without an operating system, application programmers would need to understand the intricate workings of these components, making software development impractical.

The **operating system (OS)** acts as an intermediary, providing a simpler, cleaner abstraction of the computer while managing hardware resources efficiently.

### **Key Insights:**

- **Operating Systems and UNIX Influence:**
    
    - **Android** is a software layer on top of Linux.
    - **iOS** is derived from Berkeley UNIX.
    - **Linux** is a clone of UNIX.
    - Conclusion: UNIX is the most widely adopted operating system.
- **User Interface Components:**

    - The user interacts with the system via a **shell** (text-based) or **GUI** (Graphical User Interface).
    - The shell or GUI is _not_ part of the OS but utilizes it for executing tasks.

## **Operating Modes: Kernel Mode vs. User Mode**

Most computers operate in two distinct modes:

1. **Kernel Mode (Supervisor Mode):**
    
    - The OS runs in this mode with full hardware access and unrestricted instruction execution.
    - Handles critical tasks like managing memory, I/O operations, and security enforcement.
2. **User Mode:**
    
    - Applications run in this mode with restricted access to system resources.
    - Certain operations (e.g., I/O control, hardware management) are prohibited to maintain system integrity and security.

---

## **User Mode Software and OS Responsibilities:**

- **User-Level Applications:**
    
    - Programs like web browsers, email clients, and media players run in user mode and depend on the OS for resource management.
- **System Utilities with Privileged Functions:**
    
    - Some programs, like password changers, operate in user mode but perform sensitive tasks.
    - These utilities require special protections and permissions, though they are not strictly part of the OS.
- **Modular OS Design:**
    
    - In some architectures, traditionally core OS functionalities (e.g., file systems) run in user mode rather than kernel mode.
    - This creates a blurred boundary between the OS and user-level programs, but everything running in kernel mode is undeniably part of the OS.


### 1.1 What is an Operating System?

It is hard to pin down what an operating system is other than saying it is the software that runs in kernel mode—and even that is not always true. Part of the problem is that operating systems perform two essentially unrelated functions: providing application programmers (and application programs, naturally) a clean abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these hardware resources. Depending on who is doing the talking, you might hear mostly about one function or the other. Let us now look at both.

#### The Operating System as an Extended Machine

Abstraction is key to handling the complexity of computer systems. The OS simplifies hardware complexities by providing well-defined abstractions. For example, files abstract away the intricate details of disk operations, allowing users to interact with familiar concepts such as photos, emails, and songs instead of dealing with storage technologies like SATA drives.

The OS transforms complex, inconsistent, and often cumbersome hardware interfaces into elegant, uniform abstractions, making it easier for programmers to develop applications. In essence, the OS **"turns the awful into the beautiful"** by hiding hardware complexities and presenting user-friendly interfaces.

#### The Operating System as a Resource Manager

The concept of an operating system as primarily providing abstractions to application programs is a top-down view. An alternative, bottom-up, view holds that the operating system is there to manage all the pieces of a complex system. Modern computers consist of processors, memories, timers, disks, mice, network interfaces, printers, touch screens, touch pad, and a wide variety of other devices. In the bottom-up view, the job of the operating system is to provide for an orderly and controlled allocation of the processors, memories, and I/O devices among the various programs wanting them.

In short, this view of the operating system holds that its primary task is to keep track of which programs are using which resource, to grant resource requests, to account for usage, and to mediate conflicting requests from different programs and users.

### Types of Resource Multiplexing

Resource management involves **multiplexing (sharing)** resources in two ways:

1. **Time Multiplexing**
    
    - Resources are allocated to different programs or users in a sequential manner.
    - Example:
        - The CPU is shared by running programs in turns—one program runs for a while, then another, and so on.
        - Print jobs are processed sequentially, with the OS determining the order.
    - The OS decides the scheduling policy, determining which process gets the resource next and for how long.
2. **Space Multiplexing**
    
    - Resources are divided among multiple programs simultaneously, with each getting a portion of the resource.
    - Example:
        - Main memory is divided among several running programs, allowing them to coexist rather than allocating the entire memory to a single program.
    - This approach improves efficiency by utilizing available resources optimally.

In summary, the OS acts as a **resource manager**, ensuring the fair and efficient allocation of system resources through effective time and space multiplexing strategies.

Fun Fact : Professor John Atanasoff and his graduate student Clifford Berry built
what is now regarded as the first functioning digital computer at Iowa State University.
It used 300 vacuum tubes.

### Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-line)

**Spooling** is an operating system technique used to efficiently manage input/output (I/O) operations by allowing multiple processes to share an I/O device without being blocked. It achieves this by **temporarily storing data in a buffer (usually disk storage)** before sending it to the intended output device.

---

### How Spooling Works (Step-by-Step Process)

1. **Job Submission:**
    - A process (e.g., a user printing a document) submits a request to the system.
2. **Data Storage in Spool:**
    - The OS places the print job in a spool area (temporary disk storage or memory buffer).
3. **Device Scheduling:**
    - The spooling system maintains a queue of pending jobs and sends them to the printer or I/O device sequentially.
4. **Execution:**
    - The output device (e.g., printer) processes jobs one by one, while new jobs continue to be added to the spool queue.
5. **Completion:**
    - Once a job is completed, the spooler retrieves the next job from the queue without blocking the submitting process.

---

### Example of Spooling: Print Spooling

**Scenario:**  
Suppose multiple users send documents to a shared office printer.

1. **User A submits a 50-page document.**
2. **User B submits a 10-page document.**
3. **User C submits a 30-page document.**

- Instead of waiting for each job to finish printing before sending another, the OS stores all jobs in a **print spool** (disk buffer).
- The printer processes jobs sequentially (e.g., first User A, then B, then C), while users continue their work without waiting.

---

### Advantages of Spooling

- **Concurrency:** Allows multiple processes to send output requests simultaneously.
- **Improved System Utilization:** The CPU remains busy with other tasks while I/O operations execute asynchronously.
- **Non-blocking Operation:** Programs don’t have to wait for slow devices to complete their tasks.
- **Efficient Resource Sharing:** Optimal use of slow I/O devices without conflicts.

---

### Applications of Spooling

- **Printing Systems:** Print spoolers queue multiple print requests.
- **Batch Processing:** Job spooling in large-scale data processing.
- **Email Systems:** Emails are spooled before being transmitted over the network.

---

In summary, **spooling decouples processing from slow I/O operations by buffering requests, allowing efficient multitasking and resource sharing.**
