Operating systems provide foundational abstractions like **processes**, **address spaces**, and **files** that are essential for understanding their functionality.

## 6.1 Processes

- **Definition**: A process is a program in execution, including its code, data, and runtime state.
- **Address Space**: Each process has an **address space**—a range of memory locations (0 to some maximum) it can read or write. This space contains:
    - The executable program.
    - Program data.
    - The stack (for function calls and local variables).

#### Example

Imagine you are:

1. Editing a video.
2. Running a video conversion.
3. Browsing the web.
4. Checking emails.  
    All these activities represent separate **processes** that the operating system switches between to execute concurrently.

---

### Process Suspension and Resumption

- When a process is suspended, its state must be preserved to resume later.
- Operating systems store this information in a **process table**, an array of structures containing:
    - Address space (core image).
    - Register contents.
    - Other necessary data to restart the process from where it was paused.

---

### Process Trees

- Processes can create other processes, forming a **process tree**:
    - Parent and child processes may cooperate to complete a task.
    - **Inter-process communication (IPC)** allows related processes to share information or synchronize their actions.

---

### Handling Delays and Lost Messages

- If a process requires data from an external source (e.g., a server), delays or message losses can occur.
- To mitigate this:
    1. The process sets a **timer** and continues other tasks.
    2. If no acknowledgment is received within the specified time, the OS sends an **alarm signal** to the process.
    3. The signal triggers a **signal handler**, which retransmits the message or takes corrective action.
    4. After the handler completes, the process resumes from its previous state.

---

### Signals and Traps

- **Signals**: Software equivalents of hardware interrupts used to notify a process of events like:
    - Timer expiration.
    - Illegal instructions.
    - Invalid memory access.
- When a signal occurs:
    1. The process saves its state (e.g., registers).
    2. Executes the **signal handler** to address the issue.
    3. Resumes execution from the saved state.

A trap is ==a synchronous interrupt in an operating system that occurs when a user process encounters an exception==. The trap switches the operating system to kernel mode, where the OS performs actions before returning control to the user process.

Traps are are software generated exceptions initiated by processes, like system calls or error. Interrupts are hardware generated signals from external devices, leading to CPU Context switching.

### Summary

- A **process** encapsulates everything needed to execute a program, including its memory and runtime state.
- Processes can create **process trees** and communicate via IPC.
- Signals act as an essential mechanism for managing unexpected events or delays, ensuring processes handle errors and resume seamlessly.  
    This abstraction simplifies multitasking and process management in modern operating systems.


## 6.2 Address Spaces

**Main Memory** is the computer's primary storage used to hold executing programs. In simple operating systems, only one program resides in memory at a time, necessitating **swapping**—removing the current program to load another.

---

### Multi-programming and Memory Protection

- Advanced operating systems allow **multiple programs** to reside in memory simultaneously.
- **Protection Mechanism**: Prevents programs from interfering with each other or the OS.
    - While hardware provides the protection mechanism, the operating system controls its use.

---

### Address Space Management

- Each process is allocated an **address space**, a range of memory addresses it can utilize, typically starting from **0** to a defined maximum.
- Initially, the address space was limited by the physical memory capacity. However, modern systems often have larger address spaces than the physical memory due to **32-bit (4 GB)** or **64-bit (16 EB)** address ranges.

#### Challenge:

- **What if the address space exceeds physical memory?**
    - Early systems couldn’t handle this, leading to program failure.

#### Solution: Virtual Memory

- **Virtual Memory** abstracts the address space, allowing it to exceed the physical memory capacity.
    - The OS stores parts of the address space in main memory and parts on disk or SSD.
    - It dynamically **swaps** data between main memory and storage as needed.

**Benefits of Virtual Memory**:

1. Provides the illusion of a larger memory space.
2. Decouples address space from physical memory size, enabling efficient multi-programming.
3. Enhances security by isolating process memory.

## 6.3 Files

Some Normal shit about files nothing special.

### Mounted File Systems in UNIX

- **Mounting** allows files from external storage devices (e.g., USB drives) to be seamlessly integrated into the system’s directory tree.
- Before mounting:
    - The root file system (e.g., on the hard disk) and the external device's file system (e.g., USB) are separate.
    - External devices may have different file system formats (e.g., ext4 on hard disk, FAT-32 on USB).
- After mounting:
    - The external device’s file system becomes accessible at a specific directory (e.g., Directory B).
    - As long as the device is connected, the original contents of the directory where it is mounted remain inaccessible.
- **Multiple devices** (e.g., hard disks) can be mounted into a unified directory tree, providing a single, cohesive structure.

---

### Special Files in UNIX

- **Special files** are abstractions for I/O devices, allowing them to be accessed like regular files using standard system calls (e.g., `read`, `write`).
- **Types of Special Files**:
    1. **Block Special Files**:
        - Represent devices with randomly addressable blocks, such as SSDs and disks.
        - Example: Reading block 4 of a block special file directly accesses the fourth block on the device, bypassing the file system structure.
    2. **Character Special Files**:
        - Represent devices that handle data streams, such as keyboards, mice, and printers.
- By convention, special files are stored in the `/dev` directory (e.g., `/dev/lp` for printers).

---

### Pipes

- **Pipes** are pseudofiles used for inter-process communication (IPC), allowing processes to exchange data efficiently.
- **How Pipes Work**:
    - A pipe is set up between two processes in advance.
    - Process A writes to the pipe as if it were an output file.
    - Process B reads from the pipe as if it were an input file.
- Pipes are implemented similarly to files, making inter-process communication feel like standard file operations.
- Processes can only differentiate between a regular file and a pipe by making a special system call.
