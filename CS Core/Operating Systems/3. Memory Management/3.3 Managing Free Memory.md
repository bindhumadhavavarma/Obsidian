### 🧠 Section 3.2.3 – Managing Free Memory

---

When memory is dynamically allocated to processes, the operating system is responsible for **tracking which regions of memory are free or in use**. Efficient free memory management is critical for both performance and avoiding fragmentation.

There are **two main strategies** for managing free memory:

1. **Bitmaps**
2. **Linked Lists**

These are general-purpose strategies and are also applicable to managing other resources like free disk blocks in file systems.

---

### 🔸 Memory Management with Bitmaps

- **Concept**: Divide memory into fixed-size **allocation units** (e.g., 4 bytes to several KB).
- Maintain a **bitmap** where each bit represents one unit:
  - `0` → free unit
  - `1` → occupied unit
- Example:
  - Memory blocks: `[A][B][C][H][H][H][D][E]`
  - Bitmap: `111000111...`

#### 🧮 Trade-offs:

- **Smaller allocation unit** → finer control, but larger bitmap.
- **Larger allocation unit** → smaller bitmap, but risk of internal fragmentation.

> Even with a small 4-byte unit, only 1/32 of memory is consumed by the bitmap.

#### ⚠️ Drawback:

- **Searching for free space** is slow:
  - Must scan for a run of `k` consecutive `0`s to allocate space.
  - Runs may span word boundaries in the bitmap, making search computationally costly.

---

### 🔸 Memory Management with Linked Lists

An alternative is to maintain a **linked list of memory segments**, which may be:

- Allocated to a process
- Free holes between processes

Each list node contains:
- Type (Process or Hole)
- Start address
- Length
- Pointer to next segment

> The list is usually **sorted by memory address** to simplify updates when processes terminate or are swapped out.

---

#### 🔁 Updating the List After Process Termination

When a process ends, the system updates the list:

1. **Middle of memory (two neighbors)**:
   - If both neighbors are holes → merge into one (Fig. 3-7(d)).
   - If one is a hole → merge with that one (Figs. 3-7(b)/(c)).
   - If both are processes → convert to a hole (Fig. 3-7(a)).

> 🔄 A **double-linked list** helps efficiently merge holes by providing quick access to the previous segment.

---

### 🧠 Memory Allocation Algorithms

When allocating memory for a new or swapped-in process, the memory manager uses algorithms to find suitable holes. Here's a breakdown of the most popular ones:

---

#### 1. **First Fit**

- Scans the list from the beginning.
- Allocates the **first hole that is large enough**.
- Fast because it stops searching early.

---

#### 2. **Next Fit**

- Like first fit, but **remembers where the last search ended**.
- Next search resumes from that point.
- Slightly worse performance than first fit (per simulations).

---

#### 3. **Best Fit**

- Searches the **entire list**.
- Allocates the **smallest hole that fits** the request.
- Attempts to **minimize waste**.
- Slower, and can lead to **tiny unusable holes** (increased fragmentation).

---

#### 4. **Worst Fit**

- Chooses the **largest available hole**.
- Idea: leave a big enough remainder for future use.
- Simulation results: **generally poor performance**.

---

#### Example (based on Fig. 3-6):

- **Requested block size: 2**
  - **First fit** → picks hole at address 5
  - **Best fit** → picks hole at address 18

---

### ⚙️ Optimizations and Advanced Techniques

#### 🔸 Separate Lists for Holes and Processes

- Speeds up allocation because only hole list needs to be searched.
- Increases complexity for deallocation:
  - Need to remove from process list and add to hole list.

#### 🔸 Sorted Hole Lists

- **Best fit** becomes more efficient:
  - Search stops at first adequate hole.
- For sorted lists:
  - **First fit = Best fit in speed**
  - **Next fit is redundant**

---

#### 🔸 Embedding Hole Metadata in Holes

- Instead of a separate list structure:
  - Use the **first word** of a hole to store its size
  - Use the **second word** to point to the next hole
- Saves space by eliminating external data structures.

---

#### 🔸 Quick Fit

- Maintains **separate lists for commonly requested sizes** (e.g., 4 KB, 8 KB, 12 KB, etc.).
- Extremely fast allocation.
- But comes with a significant drawback:
  - **Merging freed holes becomes harder**.
  - If holes aren’t merged properly → memory quickly fragments into tiny, unusable pieces.

---

### ✅ Summary

- **Bitmaps**: Compact, simple, but slow for allocating large continuous blocks.
- **Linked Lists**: More flexible and intuitive for variable-sized memory blocks.
- **Allocation Strategies**:
  - **First fit** is fast and generally efficient.
  - **Best fit** aims for minimal waste but often performs worse in practice.
  - **Next fit** adds locality but performs slightly worse.
  - **Worst fit** is rarely helpful.
- **Quick fit** offers fast allocation for common sizes but risks fragmentation if not merged properly.
- Maintaining **separate hole lists**, sorting by size, and embedding metadata in holes are effective optimizations.
