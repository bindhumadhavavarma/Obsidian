### ⚠️ The Problem

When a **page fault** occurs, the OS must **evict** a page to make space for the new one:
- If the page was **modified** (dirty), it must be **written back** to disk or SSD.
- If it was **clean** (unchanged), it can be simply **overwritten**.

> ❌ Evicting a heavily used page leads to frequent reloads and degrades performance.

---

### 🌍 Similar Problems in Other Domains

- **Memory Caches**: CPU caches also replace 32- or 64-byte blocks on a smaller time scale.
- **Web Servers**: Web caches evict rarely accessed pages, but web pages aren’t modified (always clean).
- **Design Analogy**: The page replacement problem appears across systems, varying in scale and volatility.

---

### 🔀 Per-Process vs Global Replacement

- Should the page to be evicted belong only to the **faulting process**, or can it come from **any process**?
- We'll revisit this question in **Section 3.5.1**.

---

## 🏆 3.4.1 The Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm

---

### 🧠 Key Idea

Evict the page that will be **used farthest in the future**.

> If page A is needed in 8M instructions and B in 6M, evict A.

---

### 📉 Why It's Not Practical

- OS can't predict **future page references**.
- It's only usable in **simulations** for benchmarking.

---

### 🧪 How It’s Used

- **Simulate a run** and log all memory accesses.
- **Second run** uses the log to simulate optimal replacement.
- Useful for comparing real algorithms' performance to theoretical best.

## 🧮 3.4.2 The Not Recently Used (NRU) Algorithm

---

### 🛠️ Mechanism

Uses two **status bits** per page:
- `R` (Referenced): Set when the page is accessed.
- `M` (Modified): Set when the page is written to.

These bits are **hardware-maintained**, or simulated by OS via **page faults and clock interrupts**.

---

### 🔢 Classification

Pages are periodically classified into four categories:

| Class | Referenced (R) | Modified (M) | Description |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0     | 0              | 0            | Not used or changed |
| 1     | 0              | 1            | Modified long ago |
| 2     | 1              | 0            | Recently read |
| 3     | 1              | 1            | Recently written |

> Clock interrupts **clear R**, not M. That’s how Class 1 can exist.

---

### 📌 Algorithm

- Evict a page at random from the **lowest-numbered non-empty class**.
- Goal: Prefer removing **old, unreferenced, or less valuable** pages.

---

### ✅ Pros

- **Simple and efficient**
- Provides **reasonable performance**
- Doesn't require keeping full history

---

## 🧾 3.4.3 The FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Algorithm

---

### 🛍️ Supermarket Analogy

Imagine a store with space for `k` products. A new product arrives:
- Remove the one added **longest ago**.
- Might remove **something useful** just because it’s old.

---

### 🖥️ OS Implementation

- Maintain a **linked list** of pages in memory.
- On page fault:
  - Remove the **head** (oldest page).
  - Insert new page at the **tail**.

---

### ⚠️ Problem

- FIFO may evict **frequently-used** but old pages.
- Example: Removing **butter** from a store shelf just because it’s old.

---

### 🚫 Usage

- **Rarely used in pure form** due to risk of evicting essential pages.
- Often improved with additional **reference tracking**.

Here’s a fully styled, icon-enhanced, Obsidian-friendly summary for **Section 3.4.4–3.4.10 – Page Replacement Algorithms (Continued)**:

## 🔄 3.4.4 Second-Chance Page Replacement

---

### 💡 Core Idea

A **refined FIFO** that gives each page a "second chance" if it's been recently used.

---

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. Inspect the **oldest page** (head of FIFO list).
2. If `R = 0`: Page is old & unused → **Evict it**.
3. If `R = 1`:  
   - Clear `R`,  
   - **Move page to end** of list (as if it just arrived),  
   - Continue search.

---

### 📊 Illustration

Imagine pages A–H in a FIFO queue.  
At time `t=20`, if A has `R=1`, it is recycled to the end with updated load time.  
Search continues with B, and so on.

---

### ✅ Pros

- Avoids evicting **frequently used** pages.
- Degenerates into **FIFO** if all pages are referenced.

---

## 🕰️ 3.4.5 Clock Page Replacement

---

### ⏰ Optimization of Second-Chance

Avoids moving pages around by organizing them in a **circular list (clock)**.

---

### 🛠️ Operation

- On **page fault**, check page pointed by the hand:
  - `R = 0`: **Evict** it.
  - `R = 1`: Clear `R`, advance hand.

🔁 Repeat until a page with `R = 0` is found.

> More efficient than Second-Chance due to reduced memory operations.

---

## 📉 3.4.6 Least Recently Used (LRU)

---

### 💡 Concept

Evict the page that was **unused for the longest time**—a realistic approximation of the **optimal** strategy.

---

### ⚙️ Full LRU Requires:

- A **linked list** of pages ordered by usage.
- Updating list on **every memory access**.

> ❗ Very **expensive to implement**, even with hardware.

---

### 🧮 Hardware-Based Approximation

- Use a **64-bit counter C** incremented per instruction.
- Each page stores the **last value of C** when referenced.
- On fault, evict page with **smallest counter** (least recently used).

---

## 🧠 3.4.7 Simulating LRU in Software

---

### 🐘 NFU – Not Frequently Used

- Each page has a **software counter**.
- On every **clock tick**:
  - Add `R` bit to counter.
- On fault, evict page with **lowest count**.

> 🔻 Downside: Remembers **too far back** (never forgets).

---

### 🔁 Aging Algorithm (Improved NFU)

1. On every clock tick:
   - Shift counter **right by 1**.
   - Insert `R` bit at **leftmost position**.
2. Clear `R`.

---

### 🧪 Example Behavior

Over 5 clock ticks:
- Recently used pages have higher binary values.
- Older pages accumulate leading zeroes → **more likely to be evicted**.

> ✅ Efficient, good **LRU approximation**, works with limited bits.

---

## 🧳 3.4.8 Working Set Algorithm

---

### 🔍 Core Idea

Only keep the **pages a process is actively using**—its **working set**.

---

### 🧾 Definitions

- **Working set** `w(k, t)`: Set of pages used in the **last `k` memory refs** (or `Δ` time).
- **Thrashing**: Excessive faults due to missing working set.

---

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. Keep a **time-of-last-use** per page.
2. On page fault:
   - If `R = 1`: update time-of-last-use.
   - If `R = 0`:
     - If age > `Δ`: **Evict** (not in working set).
     - Else: track as least recently used clean page.
3. If no pages can be evicted, choose a **clean page**, or pick one at random.

---

### 🔁 Practical Approximation

Instead of tracking k memory refs, use a **time window** (e.g., 100ms of **virtual time**).

---

## ⏱️ 3.4.9 WSClock Algorithm

---

### 🧭 Hybrid of Working Set + Clock

Efficient, practical algorithm combining **clock-style traversal** with **working set logic**.

---

### 🛠️ Algorithm Overview

1. Pages in a **circular list** with:
   - `R` bit
   - `Time of last use`
   - `M` bit (not shown)

2. On fault, scan like clock:
   - `R = 1`: clear it, move on.
   - `R = 0`:
     - If **clean** and **age > Δ** → Evict.
     - If **dirty** → schedule write, move on.

3. After full sweep:
   - If writes were scheduled → wait for one to complete.
   - If no writes → evict **any clean page**.

---

### ✅ Advantages

- Avoids full table scan.
- **Efficient**, widely used in real-world OSs.

---

## 🧾 3.4.10 Summary of Algorithms

### 🏁 Final Takeaways

- **Aging** and **WSClock** are the best **pure algorithms**.
- OSs use **custom hybrids** depending on workload and hardware.
  - **Windows** blends Clock, Working Set.
  - **Linux** uses **split LRU lists** for file-backed vs anonymous pages.

💥 What is Thrashing?
Thrashing occurs when a process spends more time handling page faults than doing useful work. This happens when the process doesn't have enough memory to hold its working set, leading to constant swapping of pages in and out of memory.

🔁 Why Thrashing Happens
A process accesses more pages than can fit in its allocated memory.

Pages that were just evicted are immediately needed again.

Causes a loop of page faults with very little progress in actual execution.

Example: A compiler phase accesses a set of pages, but not all fit in memory → OS keeps loading and evicting pages as the process cycles through them.

🧠 Consequences
Dramatic drop in performance.

CPU utilization plummets, as it's mostly waiting for I/O (disk access).

Can lead to system-wide slowdowns in multiprogramming environments.

🔍 Key Indicator
Page fault rate becomes very high (e.g., one page fault every few instructions).

✅ Prevention
Ensure each process has enough memory for its working set.

Use smarter page replacement algorithms like:

Working Set Model

WSClock

Employ load control: temporarily swap out some processes to reduce memory pressure.
