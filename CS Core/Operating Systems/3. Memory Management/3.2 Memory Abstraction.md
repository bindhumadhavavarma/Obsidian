### ðŸ§  Memory Abstraction â€“ Address Spaces (Section 3.2)

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Why Physical Memory Exposure Is Problematic

- Giving user programs access to physical memory directly introduces major problems:
  1. **System Stability Risk**: Programs can easily corrupt the OS memory space, either accidentally or maliciously.
  2. **Inability to Multitask Safely**: It's difficult to have multiple applications in memory at once since they may overwrite each otherâ€™s memory.

- Even with only one program in memory, allowing it unrestricted access is unsafe without hardware protection mechanisms (e.g., IBM 360â€™s lock-and-key system).

- **Modern computing expectations**, such as running a browser, word processor, and email app simultaneously, require abstraction beyond raw physical memory.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ 3.2.1 The Notion of an Address Space

- To run multiple applications safely and simultaneously, the system must ensure:
  - **Protection**: Programs should not interfere with each other or with the OS.
  - **Relocation**: Programs should be loadable at different physical addresses without modification.

- A **better solution** than tagging memory (as in IBM 360) is to introduce a **new abstraction** called the **address space**.

##### ðŸ“Œ What is an Address Space?

- An address space is the **range of memory addresses a process believes it owns**.
- Just like a process abstracts the CPU, an address space **abstracts memory**.
- Each process is given its own private address space, isolated from others unless explicitly shared.

##### ðŸ“Œ Examples of Address Spaces in the Real World

- **Telephone numbers**: Range from 0000000 to 9999999.
- **I/O ports on x86**: Range from 0 to 16383.
- **IPv4 addresses**: 0 to 2Â³Â²â€“1.
- **Domain names**: Strings with a defined structure like `example.com`.

> ðŸ”‘ Key point: Address spaces can be numeric or symbolic, and are useful in providing scoped, unique, and manageable identitiesâ€”similar to how we need isolated memory spaces in programs.

#### ðŸ”¹ Base and Limit Registers â€“ A Simple Implementation of Address Spaces

- This method enables **dynamic relocation** by hardware.

##### ðŸ”¸ How It Works:

1. **Base Register**: Stores the starting physical address of the process in RAM.
2. **Limit Register**: Stores the size (length) of the process memory.

- When a process generates an address (e.g., `JMP 28`), the CPU adds the base value:
  - E.g., if base = 16,384 â†’ `JMP 28` becomes `JMP 16,412`
- The CPU also checks if the effective address is < limit; otherwise, it raises a **fault**.

##### ðŸ”¸ Benefits:

- Each process runs in a logically consistent address space.
- Protection is enforced because the process can't reference memory beyond its limit.
- No need to modify addresses during loading (unlike static relocation).

##### ðŸ”¸ Drawbacks:

- Each memory access requires:
  - **One addition (base + offset)**
  - **One comparison (check against limit)**
- Additions may be slower unless optimized by special hardware circuits.

##### ðŸ”¸ Hardware Support and Safety:

- On some systems (e.g., CDC 6600), only the **OS could modify** these registers.
- On others (e.g., Intel 8088), there were base registers but **no limit checks**, hence **no built-in protection**.

#### ðŸ”¹ 3.2.2 Swapping â€“ Handling Memory Overload

- Modern systems often have **more active processes than available RAM**.
  - Background services, update checkers, user applications like Photoshop can consume significant memory.

##### ðŸ“Œ Two Solutions for Memory Overload:

1. **Swapping** (discussed in this section):  
   - Load a process into memory, run it, then move it back to disk/SSD to free space.
   - Only active processes occupy RAM.
  
2. **Virtual Memory** (discussed later):  
   - Processes can run even if only partially loaded in memory.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ How Swapping Works (Fig. 3-4)

- Over time, processes are brought into memory or removed:

- Processes may be loaded into **different physical locations** each time.
- **Address relocation** must happen dynamically, often using base/limit registers.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ Memory Fragmentation and Compaction

- Swapping creates **holes (unused spaces)** in memory.
- To combine these holes into a single block:
  - **Memory Compaction** is used (shift processes down in memory).
  - **Very costly**: e.g., copying 16 GB at 8 bytes per 8 ns takes ~16 seconds.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ Allocating Space for Growing Processes

- If processes are **fixed-size**, memory allocation is simple.
- If processes **grow dynamically** (e.g., heap in C/C++, Java objects):
  - Memory next to the process must be free for expansion.
  - If not, options are:
    - Move the process to a larger hole.
    - Swap out other processes.
    - Suspend or kill the process if no memory is available.

- **Optimization**: Pre-allocate a bit more space than needed when loading a process to reduce future relocation/swapping.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ Two-Growth-Segment Model (Fig. 3-5)

- Modern processes may grow in two directions:
  1. **Heap (Data Segment)** grows **upward**
  2. **Stack** grows **downward**
- Layout:
  - Code â†’ Data â†’ free space â†’ Stack (grows down)
- If they **collide**, action is needed:
  - Move process
  - Swap it out
  - Or terminate it

---

> ðŸ§  Summary:
- **Address spaces** isolate process memory.
- **Base and limit registers** implement dynamic relocation and protection.
- **Swapping** allows more processes than physical RAM.
- **Memory compaction** and **growth handling** are important for managing fragmentation and process dynamics.
