### 🧠 Memory Management – Chapter 3 Notes

---

#### 🔹 Introduction

- RAM is a critical resource requiring careful OS management.
- Though memory sizes have grown massively since the 1960s, program sizes grow even faster.
- Paraphrasing Parkinson’s Law: **"Programs expand to fill available memory."**
- Ideal memory: infinite size, infinite speed, nonvolatile, cheap — doesn't exist yet.
- **Memory hierarchy** (fastest to slowest):
  - Cache (MBs) → Main Memory (GBs) → Storage (TBs) → Removable (e.g., USB)
- The **OS abstracts and manages** this hierarchy through the **memory manager**.

---

#### 🔹 Role of the Memory Manager

- Keeps track of memory usage.
- Allocates and deallocates memory to/from processes.
- Primarily manages **main memory**, not cache (done by hardware).
- Disk/SSD abstraction is handled in a later chapter.

---

### 3.1 🚫 No Memory Abstraction

---

#### 🔸 Early Systems

- Early computers had **no memory abstraction**:
  - Programs directly accessed **physical memory**.
  - Instruction like `MOV REGISTER1,1000` moved data from physical location 1000.
- Memory was seen as a linear array of addresses.
- **Only one program could run at a time** to avoid conflicts.
- Overlapping programs would overwrite each other and crash.

#### 🔸 Memory Layout Variants (Fig. 3-1)

1. **OS in RAM (bottom)** — used in old mainframes/minicomputers.
2. **OS in ROM (top)** — used in handheld/embedded systems.
3. **Drivers in ROM, rest of OS in RAM** — used in early PCs (BIOS in ROM).

> ❗ Models (a) and (c) are dangerous: bugs in user programs can overwrite the OS.

---

#### 🔸 Execution Model

- One process loaded at a time.
- After program execution, OS loads another by **overwriting memory**.
- Slight parallelism possible via **threads**, as all threads share memory.

---

#### 3.1.1 Running Multiple Programs Without Memory Abstraction

---

##### 🔹 Swapping Method

- OS saves memory image of a program to disk, loads next program.
- Only one in memory at a time → **no conflicts**.

##### 🔹 Protection Keys: IBM 360 Hardware Solution

- Memory divided into 2KB blocks.
- Each block had a **4-bit protection key**.
- CPU’s **Program Status Word (PSW)** had a key; access mismatch triggered a trap.
- Prevented interference between processes and OS.

---

##### 🔹 Problem: Absolute Addressing (Fig. 3-2)

- Programs use **absolute addresses** (e.g., JMP 28).
- After relocation (e.g., to address 16,384), such jumps **go to wrong locations**, leading to crashes.
- Programs must reference memory **relatively**, not absolutely.

---

##### 🔹 Static Relocation

- Loader adds base address (e.g., 16,384) to every address in the code.
- Relocation is **static** and done **during loading**.
- Needs metadata to identify which values are addresses vs constants.
  - Example:
    - `JMP 28` → relocated
    - `MOV REGISTER1,28` → not relocated

---

#### 🔸 Embedded Systems Still Lack Memory Abstraction

- Embedded devices (e.g., microwaves, washing machines) often:
  - Run software directly from ROM.
  - Use **absolute addressing**.
- Users can't run custom software, so this is acceptable.

---

#### 🔸 Modern Use of Old Techniques

- Intel x86 CPUs reintroduced **protection keys** in 2017.
  - Now seen as a **security feature**, despite originating in the 1960s.
- History repeats:
  - Advanced systems use full memory management.
  - Simpler systems revert to minimal or library-based OS models (e.g., **e-Cos**).
