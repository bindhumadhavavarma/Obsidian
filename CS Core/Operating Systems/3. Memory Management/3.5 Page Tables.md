### 🧠 Section 3.3.2 – Page Tables

---

With **paging**, the system needs a data structure that maps **virtual pages** to **physical page frames**. This is where **page tables** come into play. They are a central mechanism in virtual memory systems and are managed both by hardware (for translation) and by the OS (for memory management decisions).

---

### 🔸 Basic Structure and Operation of a Page Table

- A **virtual address** is split into two parts:
  1. **Virtual page number (VPN)** – upper bits
  2. **Offset** – lower bits (the byte’s position within the page)

> Example:  
> For a 16-bit address and 4-KB page size:  
> - 4 bits → virtual page number (16 pages total)  
> - 12 bits → offset (0 to 4095)

- The **VPN is used as an index** into the page table to retrieve the **page frame number (PFN)**.
- The **PFN replaces the VPN** in the original address to produce a physical memory address.
- The offset remains unchanged and is appended to the PFN.

> 🔁 Thus, the page table implements a **function**:  
> `VPN → PFN`  
> And the final address becomes: `PFN + offset`

---

### 🔹 Example: MMU Operation (Ref: Fig. 3-10)

- **Input virtual address**: 8196 → binary: `0010 0000 0000 0100`
  - VPN = `0010` = Page 2
  - Offset = `0000 0000 0000 0100` = 4
- **Page table** maps Page 2 → Frame 6
- Final physical address = `frame 6 base + offset = 24576 + 4 = 24580`

> MMU checks the **present/absent bit**. If the page is absent, it triggers a **page fault**.

### 🔹 Structure of a Page Table Entry (PTE)

Page table entries are typically 64 bits in modern systems. Here's a breakdown of what's stored:

#### 1. **Page Frame Number (PFN)**
- Most important field—used for final address translation.
- With 4 KB pages, only the top 52 bits are used (assuming 64-bit entry).

#### 2. **Present/Absent Bit**
- Indicates whether the page is in physical memory.
- If `0` → page fault occurs when accessed.

#### 3. **Protection Bits**
- Control what kinds of access are allowed:
  - **1-bit version**: `0 = read/write`, `1 = read-only`
  - **3-bit version**: Enable/disable read, write, execute separately.

#### 4. **Supervisor/User Bit**
- Controls **privilege level**:
  - `Supervisor = 1` → accessible only by OS
  - User programs get a fault if they try to access it.

#### 5. **Modified Bit (Dirty Bit)**
- Set automatically when a page is written to.
- Helps the OS decide if a page needs to be written back to disk before eviction.
  - If dirty → must write to disk
  - If clean → can discard (copy still exists on disk)

#### 6. **Referenced Bit**
- Set when the page is accessed (read or write).
- Used by page replacement algorithms to choose which page to evict.
  - Unused pages are better candidates for eviction.

#### 7. **Caching Disabled Bit**
- Useful for memory-mapped I/O.
- Ensures the CPU **does not cache reads/writes**, which would prevent updates from reaching actual devices.

> 🛠 Note: Machines with **separate I/O space** don’t need this caching bit since device communication doesn’t use memory addresses.

---

### 🧠 Conceptual View

- The page table is a hardware-assisted **mechanism to support the abstraction of address spaces**.
- It allows **virtual addresses** (used by all programs, including the OS) to be **mapped to physical memory**.
- Every software memory access is **via virtual addresses**.

---

### 🔹 Page Tables for the OS Itself

- Even the **kernel uses virtual memory**.
- Kernel code/data is mapped into virtual addresses too.
- During a **system call**, control transfers to the OS.

#### 🧠 Optimization Trick:

- Rather than **switching page tables** during a system call:
  - The OS is **mapped into every process’s address space**, but...
  - **Supervisor bit** is set → only accessible in kernel mode.
  - Prevents user code from touching OS memory, while **avoiding expensive page table switches**.

#### 🔧 Layout:

- Kernel mappings are usually at the **top of the virtual address space**.
- User programs start at lower addresses (e.g., 0 or 4 KB).
  - Some systems purposely avoid starting at address 0 to **catch null pointer dereferences** via fault traps.

---

### ✅ Summary

- The **page table** translates virtual pages to physical page frames.
- Each **page table entry (PTE)** holds:
  - Frame number, presence info, access rights, dirty/reference bits, etc.
- Hardware (MMU) uses the PTE to perform address translation and trap on errors.
- The **OS uses separate tables** to track additional info like disk location of paged-out entries.
- **Optimizations** like mapping the OS into all address spaces can **reduce context-switch overhead**.
- This entire mechanism **supports the abstraction of an address space**, which allows memory isolation, protection, and efficient sharing.
