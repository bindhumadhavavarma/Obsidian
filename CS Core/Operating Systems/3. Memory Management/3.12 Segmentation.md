### 🧩 3.7 Segmentation

#### 🔹 Motivation
- Traditional virtual memory is one-dimensional: a single linear address space.
- Some programs (e.g., compilers) benefit from multiple, independent address spaces:
  - Source text
  - Symbol table
  - Constants
  - Parse tree
  - Call stack

#### 🔹 Concept of Segmentation
- Each **segment** is a logically independent linear address space.
- Addresses are two-part: `(segment number, offset)`.
- Segments grow/shrink independently → better memory organization.
- Simplifies procedure linking and avoids overlapping data regions.
- Useful for:
  - **Modularity** and **protection** (e.g., read-only code segments)
  - **Sharing** common procedures/libraries
  - **Bug catching** via segment-level protection

#### 📊 Comparison: Paging vs Segmentation
| Feature                              | Paging               | Segmentation           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Programmer awareness                 | No                    | Yes                     |
| Address spaces                       | One                   | Many                    |
| Independent table growth             | No                    | Yes                     |
| Sharing and protection granularity   | Low                   | High                    |
| Motivation                           | Simulate large memory | Logical structure/mgmt  |

### ⚙️ 3.7.1 Implementation of Pure Segmentation

#### 🧱 Segmentation without Paging
- Memory holes occur when segments are evicted/replaced: **external fragmentation**.
- Over time, leads to "checkerboarding" → resolved via **compaction**.
- Compaction reorganizes segments to eliminate holes, freeing contiguous space.

### 🏗️ 3.7.2 Segmentation with Paging: MULTICS

#### 🧠 Overview
- MULTICS combined paging + segmentation for flexibility and modularity.
- Supported up to **2¹⁸ segments**, each paged and up to **64K words**.
- Each segment had its own **page table**.

#### 🧾 Address Translation
- Address = `(segment number, page number, offset)`
- Steps:
  1. Locate segment descriptor
  2. Check/load page table (segment fault if missing)
  3. Access page table to locate physical page
  4. Add offset to get physical address
  5. Perform memory read/write

#### 🔒 Protection
- Each segment had separate protection bits.
- MULTICS also introduced **TLB** (Translation Lookaside Buffer) to speed up translation:
  - First system to use TLBs
  - Cached mappings of recently used virtual → physical pages

### 🧬 3.7.3 Segmentation with Paging: Intel x86

#### 🖥️ Legacy Model (Pre x86-64)
- Had **16K segments**, each up to **1B 32-bit words**.
- Supported full MULTICS-style segmentation + paging.
- Segments used for modularity, security, and fast intra-kernel communication.

#### 📉 Deprecation in x86-64
- x86-64 dropped full segmentation support (only legacy/compatibility).
- Reason: Neither UNIX nor Windows adopted it due to portability concerns.
- Developers preferred simpler paging-only models → segmentation seen as unnecessary overhead.

#### ✅ Design Evaluation
- Despite complexity, x86 segmentation system was elegant given its compatibility constraints.
- MULTICS influence is evident, especially in dual-layer translation (segment + page).

### 🧾 Chapter 3 Summary: Memory Management

#### 🧱 Basic Memory Models
- **Simplest systems**: No swapping or paging.
  - Programs stay in memory until completion.
  - Only one process in memory (e.g., small embedded systems).

#### 🔁 Swapping
- Allows **more processes than available memory**.
- Swapped-out processes stored on **disk/SSD**.
- Free space managed via:
  - **Bitmaps**
  - **Hole lists**

#### 📦 Virtual Memory & Paging
- Address space is divided into **fixed-size pages**.
- Pages mapped into **available page frames**.
- **Page replacement algorithms** handle memory pressure:
  - 📌 **Aging**: Software LRU approximation.
  - ⏰ **WSClock**: Efficient working set-based strategy.

#### 🧠 Efficient Paging Needs:
- Algorithm choice is not enough.
- Key design factors:
  - **Working set detection**
  - **Local vs global allocation**
  - **Page size tuning**

#### 🧩 Segmentation
- Enables **dynamic data structure management**.
- Benefits:
  - Simplifies **linking**, **sharing**, and **protection**.
  - Each segment has a **logical purpose** (e.g., stack, heap, code).
- Often **combined with paging** for flexible two-level memory.

#### 🏛️ Notable Systems
- **MULTICS**:
  - Combined segmentation and paging elegantly.
  - Introduced **TLB**.
- **Intel x86 (pre-x86-64)**:
  - Supported **segmented paging**.
  - Phased out in x86-64 due to lack of OS adoption.
