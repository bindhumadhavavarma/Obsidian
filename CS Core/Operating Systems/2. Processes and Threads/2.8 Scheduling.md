### 2.5 Scheduling

When multiple processes or threads are in the ready state, the **scheduler** decides which one runs next. The method it uses is called the **scheduling algorithm**.

### 2.5.1 Introduction to Scheduling

- **Old batch systems:** Simply executed jobs one by one from tape.
- **Multiprogrammed systems:** Need to select among many ready processes.
- **Modern PCs:**
  - Usually run a single active process.
  - Scheduling not critical as CPU is rarely a bottleneck.
- **Networked servers & IoT devices:**
  - Have many competing processes.
  - Scheduling is important due to resource constraints or power efficiency (e.g., battery life).

---

### Process Switching (Context Switching)

- Involves saving current process state (registers, memory map).
- Selecting and loading the new process.
- Can flush the memory cache.
- **Expensive operation**, should be minimized.

---

### Process Behavior

- Processes alternate between **CPU bursts** and **I/O waits**.

#### Types:
- **CPU-bound:** Long CPU bursts, infrequent I/O.
- **I/O-bound:** Short CPU bursts, frequent I/O.

Faster CPUs → Processes appear more I/O-bound → I/O-bound process scheduling becomes more important.

### When to Schedule

1. **Process creation:** Choose to run parent or child.
2. **Process exit:** Pick another ready process.
3. **Process block:** Another process must be scheduled.
4. **I/O interrupt:** Choose between ready, interrupted, or third process.
5. **Clock interrupt (preemptive scheduling):** Scheduler decides at regular intervals.

#### Scheduling Types:

- **Nonpreemptive:** A running process continues until it blocks or finishes.
- **Preemptive:** A running process is forcibly suspended after a fixed time slice.

---

### Scheduling Environments

1. **Batch Systems:**
   - Nonpreemptive or long time slice preemptive.
   - Focus on throughput and efficiency.
2. **Interactive Systems:**
   - Preemptive to avoid CPU hogging.
   - Focus on fast response and user experience.
3. **Real-Time Systems:**
   - May not need preemption.
   - Emphasis on **meeting deadlines** and **predictability**.

### Scheduling Goals

#### General
- **Fairness:** Equal treatment for similar processes.
- **Policy Enforcement:** System policy (e.g., safety-critical processes) must be honored.
- **Balance:** Keep CPU and I/O devices busy together.

#### Batch Systems
- **Throughput:** Maximize jobs completed per hour.
- **Turnaround Time:** Minimize job completion time.
- **CPU Utilization:** Keep CPU active, but not a great metric by itself.

#### Interactive Systems
- **Response Time:** Minimize time between request and response.
- **Proportionality:** Meet user expectations for perceived task complexity.

#### Real-Time Systems
- **Meeting Deadlines:** Critical for data collection/control.
- **Predictability:** Ensure smooth multimedia (audio/video) experience.

### Key Insights

- Scheduling strategy depends heavily on **context**: PC vs server vs embedded.
- **Mixing CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes** improves overall system utilization.
- Different goals conflict; a scheduler might optimize one metric at the cost of another (e.g., throughput vs turnaround time).
- **Designing good scheduling algorithms** requires a clear understanding of system goals and process behavior.

### 2.5.2 Scheduling in Batch Systems

#### First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- **Nonpreemptive**: Processes run in the order they arrive.
- **Simple to implement**: Single queue, easy insertion/removal.
- **Fairness**: Works like a queue at a ticket counter.
- **Drawback**: I/O-bound processes may suffer when behind long CPU-bound jobs (convoy effect).

#### Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Picks the process with the **shortest estimated run time**.
- **Optimal for minimizing average turnaround time** when all jobs arrive at the same time.
- Drawback: Doesn’t handle late-arriving short jobs optimally.

#### Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
- **Preemptive version of SJF**.
- Scheduler always runs the job with the **shortest remaining time**.
- New arrivals can preempt the current process if they have a shorter total run time.

### 2.5.3 Scheduling in Interactive Systems

#### Round-Robin (RR)
- **Each process gets a time quantum** to run.
- If still running after quantum, it's preempted and placed at the end of the ready queue.
- **Efficient** with medium quantum (20–50 ms).
- **Tradeoff**:
  - Too short: Excessive context switches.
  - Too long: Poor response for short requests.

#### Priority Scheduling
- Each process has a **priority level**.
- **Higher-priority** processes run first.
- Priority may be **static** (assigned once) or **dynamic** (based on behavior, e.g., I/O bound).
- Dynamic priority can be set as `priority = 1 / f` where `f` is the fraction of the last quantum used.

##### Priority Class Scheduling
- Processes grouped into classes (e.g., 4 to 1).
- RR used within a class, higher classes always preferred.

#### Multiple Queues
- Used in **CTSS**: processes move to lower-priority classes over time if they use their full time quantum.
- Helps balance **interactive and CPU-bound** jobs.
- Special handling: e.g., pressing Enter promotes process to the top class.

#### Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- Apply SJF to **interactive commands** by estimating process time.
- Use **aging** technique: weighted average of previous execution times.
- With α = ½, the estimates decay quickly:
  ```
  T0, T0/2 + T1/2, T0/4 + T1/4 + T2/2, ...
  ```

#### Guaranteed Scheduling
- Ensure each user or process gets their **fair CPU share**.
- Maintain ratio: `actual CPU time / entitled time`.
- Always run the process with the **lowest ratio**.
- Example: Linux **CFS** (Completely Fair Scheduler) uses a red-black tree to track execution time.

#### Lottery Scheduling
- Assign **lottery tickets** to processes.
- At each scheduling point, **pick a random ticket**.
- More tickets = higher chance to run.
- Highly **responsive** and supports **resource sharing** (e.g., clients giving tickets to servers).
- **Example use case**: Video servers sending frames at different rates.

#### Fair-Share Scheduling
- Allocate CPU **fairly among users**, not just processes.
- Enforces user-level quotas.
- Example:
  - User A (4 processes), User B (1 process)
  - If each user is entitled to 50%, User A’s processes will alternate with User B's.

### 2.5.4 Scheduling in Real-Time Systems

#### Characteristics
- Must **respond to events within fixed deadlines**.
- **Hard real-time**: Missing a deadline is unacceptable.
- **Soft real-time**: Occasional misses tolerated.

#### Types of Events
- **Periodic**: Occur at regular intervals.
- **Aperiodic**: Occur unpredictably.

#### Schedulability Test
- For `m` periodic events with execution time `C_i` and period `P_i`, the system is schedulable if:
  ```
  Σ (C_i / P_i) ≤ 1
  ```

#### Example
- Events with periods: 100, 200, 500 ms
- Required CPU times: 50, 30, 100 ms
- Load: `0.5 + 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.85 < 1` → Schedulable

#### Static vs Dynamic Scheduling
- **Static**: All scheduling decisions made before execution starts.
- **Dynamic**: Decisions made during execution.
- Static is simpler but only feasible with complete knowledge of workloads and deadlines.
