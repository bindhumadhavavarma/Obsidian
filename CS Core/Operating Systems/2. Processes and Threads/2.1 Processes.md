#### **Multiprogramming in a Computer System**

At any given time, multiple processes are running in a computer system. A **multiprogramming OS** ensures **efficient CPU utilization** by quickly switching between processes, running each for **a few milliseconds**.

- While only **one process runs on a CPU at any instant**, in a second, the CPU may **switch between several processes**, creating the **illusion of parallel execution** (called **pseudoparallelism**).
- In **multiprocessor systems**, multiple CPUs **truly** execute processes in parallel, sharing the same **physical memory**.
- To manage this complexity, **operating systems use a conceptual model** where processes are handled sequentially.

---

### **The Process Model**

- In this model, **all runnable software is structured into sequential processes**.
- A **process** is an **instance of an executing program**, including:
    - The **program counter** (tracks the next instruction).
    - **Registers** (store temporary data).
    - **Variables** (contain process-specific data).
- Each process **conceptually has its own virtual CPU**, but in reality, the OS **rapidly switches the real CPU between processes** (**multiprogramming**).

##### **Multiprocessing & CPU Count**

- If a system has **one CPU**, only **one process runs at a time**.
- If a system has **two CPU cores**, **two processes** can run simultaneously.

---

### **Process vs. Program**

A **program** is just a **static set of instructions** stored on disk, while a **process** is an **active execution** of that program.

#### **Analogy: Baking a Cake**

- **Program** = The **recipe** (instructions).
- **Process** = The **baking activity** (execution).
- **CPU** = The **baker** (who follows the instructions).
- **Input Data** = The **ingredients** (flour, eggs, sugar, etc.).

A program **does nothing unless it is executed**, just like a recipe is useless unless someone **actively follows it** to make a cake. A process, on the other hand, **actively carries out the instructions** of a program.

### **Process Creation**

In general-purpose systems, we cannot keep all possible processes loaded simultaneously (as there could be billions). Instead, processes are **created and terminated** as needed. The **four main events** that trigger process creation are:

1. **System Initialization** – When the OS starts, it creates essential processes.
2. **Execution of a process-creation system call** – A running process can create another process.
3. **User Request** – A user may explicitly request to start a new process.
4. **Batch Job Initiation** – Automated scripts or scheduled jobs can trigger process creation.

#### **Foreground and Background Processes (Daemons)**

- Some processes directly interact with users (**foreground processes**).
- Others, called **daemons**, run in the background to perform essential system tasks (e.g., managing networks, logging events).

#### **Process Creation in UNIX & Windows**

- **UNIX** uses the `fork` system call, which **duplicates the existing process** (same memory, environment variables, and open files). Usually, the child process then calls `execve` to load a new program.
- **Windows** uses the `CreateProcess` function, which **handles both process creation and program loading**. It takes **10 parameters** that control execution, security, priority, and window settings.

### **Process Termination**

A process can terminate due to one of four reasons:

1. **Normal Exit (Voluntary)** – The process completes successfully.
2. **Error Exit (Voluntary)** – The process encounters an issue and exits.
3. **Fatal Error (Involuntary)** – The process crashes due to an unhandled error.
4. **Killed by Another Process (Involuntary)** – A process is forcibly stopped by another process.

- **UNIX** uses the `exit` system call, while **Windows** uses `ExitProcess`.
- In some cases, a process can terminate another process using `kill` in UNIX and `TerminateProcess` in Windows. However, proper **authorization** is required.
- Unlike some systems where killing a parent process also kills all its children, **neither UNIX nor Windows follows this rule**.

---

### **Process Hierarchies**

A process may create **child processes**, forming a **hierarchy (or tree structure)**.

#### **Process Hierarchy in UNIX**

- When a UNIX system boots, a special **init process** is created.
- **Init reads a configuration file** and spawns processes for **each terminal session**.
- If a user logs in, a shell starts, which may create additional processes (e.g., opening a text editor or running a script).
- This creates a **single tree structure** where **init is the root**.

#### **Windows Process Model**

- Windows does **not** maintain a **process hierarchy**.
- All processes are **equal** after creation.
- The only link between parent and child processes is a **"handle"** (a token that allows control). This handle can be passed to other processes, **breaking any hierarchy**.
- Unlike UNIX, Windows **allows child processes to be detached** from their parent.

### **Process States**

A process in an operating system can be in **one of three states**:

1. **Running** – Actively using the CPU.
2. **Ready** – Waiting for CPU time (runnable but currently not executing).
3. **Blocked** – Waiting for an external event (e.g., I/O completion) before it can proceed.

- **The key difference**: The **Ready** and **Running** states are similar in that both are willing to execute, but the **Blocked** state means the process cannot proceed even if the CPU is available.

#### **State Transitions**

A process can transition between states through four main transitions:

1. **Running → Blocked** (Transition 1) – When a process cannot continue execution (e.g., waiting for user input or I/O). In UNIX, a process may be blocked automatically when trying to read an unavailable input.
2. **Running → Ready** (Transition 2) – When the CPU scheduler decides that the process has run long enough and switches to another process.
3. **Ready → Running** (Transition 3) – When the CPU scheduler selects a process from the ready queue to execute.
4. **Blocked → Ready** (Transition 4) – When an external event (e.g., I/O completion) allows the process to resume execution. If the CPU is free, it moves to Running; otherwise, it waits in the Ready state.

---

### **Implementation of Processes**

The operating system maintains a **process table** (also called **Process Control Blocks - PCB**), which keeps track of all active processes. Each process entry in this table contains:

- **Process state** (Running, Ready, or Blocked).
- **Program counter** (where execution will resume if interrupted).
- **Stack pointer** (to manage function calls and local variables).
- **Memory allocation** (assigned memory locations).
- **Open file information** (list of currently accessed files).
- **Scheduling information** (priority, CPU time used).

This process table is critical for managing multiple processes efficiently and ensuring a process resumes execution exactly where it left off.

### **Interrupt Handling & Process Switching**

![[{EE65766E-824B-40A5-8B0A-8BAE5ABD8D45}.png]]

- **Interrupts** are triggered by I/O devices (e.g., keyboard input, disk read completion).
- Each **interrupt type** has a **fixed memory location** called an **interrupt vector** that points to the appropriate **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.
- When an interrupt occurs:
    1. The CPU **saves the state** of the currently executing process (registers, program counter, stack pointer) in the process table.
    2. The CPU jumps to the **ISR** stored in the interrupt vector.
    3. The ISR **processes the event** (e.g., handling an I/O completion).
    4. The scheduler decides **which process to run next** (could be the same or a different process).
    5. The saved process state is restored, and execution resumes.

A process may be interrupted **thousands of times** during execution, but after each interrupt, it resumes **exactly where it left off**, ensuring **seamless process execution**.

### **Modelling Multiprogramming**

Multiprogramming allows multiple processes to reside in memory simultaneously, improving CPU utilization. However, CPU efficiency depends on how much time processes spend waiting for I/O operations.

#### **CPU Utilization Formula**

If a process spends a fraction **p** of its time waiting for I/O, the probability that all **n** processes are waiting for I/O (making the CPU idle) is **pⁿ**. Thus, CPU utilization is given by:

CPU Utilization=1−pnCPU \, Utilization = 1 - p^nCPUUtilization=1−pn

This formula helps estimate CPU performance based on the degree of multiprogramming (**n**) and I/O wait fraction (**p**).

#### **Impact of Multiprogramming on Performance**

Consider a system with **8 GB RAM**, with **2 GB used by the OS** and each user program occupying **2 GB**, allowing **three programs** to run simultaneously. If **p = 0.8** (80% I/O wait), the CPU utilization is:

1−0.83=49%1 - 0.8^3 = 49\%1−0.83=49%

Increasing memory to **16 GB** allows **seven programs** to run, raising CPU utilization to **79%**. Adding another **8 GB** improves utilization from **79% to 91%**, but the benefit is smaller.
