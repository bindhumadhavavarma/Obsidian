### 2.5.5 Policy vs Mechanism

- **Problem**: The OS scheduler does not take input from user processes, even when the user knows which child processes are more important (e.g., in a database system).
- **Solution**: **Separate policy and mechanism**:
  - **Mechanism**: Implemented in the kernel (e.g., priority scheduling).
  - **Policy**: Set by user processes (e.g., parent process can change child priorities).
- **Key Principle**: Flexibility by allowing user-level customization of kernel behavior through parameters.

### 2.5.6 Thread Scheduling

#### User-Level Threads

- **Kernel unaware** of threads; schedules the process as a whole.
- **Thread scheduler** inside the process decides which thread to run.
- **No clock interrupts** to preempt threads â†’ thread runs until:
  - It yields the CPU voluntarily.
  - The quantum of the parent process ends.

**Example**:  
With a 50ms quantum and 5ms per thread burst:
- Kernel sees only `Process A`, but thread scheduler alternates: A1, A2, A3, A1, A2, A3, etc.

#### Kernel-Level Threads

- **Kernel is aware of individual threads** and schedules them directly.
- **Preemptive**: Threads have their own quanta.
- **More flexibility**: Kernel can switch between threads from different processes.
- **Example**: A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3 (interleaved threads from multiple processes).

#### Key Differences

| Feature                    | User-Level Threads     | Kernel-Level Threads     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Scheduling                | Done in user space     | Done by kernel           |
| Context switch cost       | Very low               | High (memory map switch)|
| Blocking effect           | Blocks entire process  | Blocks only the thread   |
| Application-specific logic| Possible               | Not easily               |

- **Optimization**: Kernel may favor threads from the same process to avoid cache and memory map switches.
- **Use Case**: Application-specific schedulers (e.g., web servers) can better optimize thread behavior than the kernel.

### 2.6 Research on Processes and Threads

- **Processes**: Well-established concept; little ongoing research.
- **Threads**:
  - Some research in **scalability and core-aware management** (e.g., Linux scalability).
  - Studies on **concurrency bugs**, especially in file systems and services.
  - **Read-Copy-Update (RCU)** is used to avoid locks.
- **Process replay tools**: Help developers debug by capturing and replaying execution (e.g., Viennot et al., 2013).
- **Security impact on scheduling**: E.g., Windows prevents cross-domain core sharing due to Spectre/Meltdown (2018).
- **Modern scheduling research areas**:
  - Deep learning cluster scheduling
  - Scheduling in microservices
  - Real-time schedulability

### 2.7 Summary

- **Processes**: Independent execution units with private address spaces.
- **Threads**: Lightweight processes within a process, sharing address space but having individual stacks.
- **Thread models**:
  - User-level: fast but limited.
  - Kernel-level: more powerful, but slower context switches.
- **Event-driven model**: Alternative to threads using non-blocking system calls and a central event loop.
- **IPC and synchronization**:
  - Semaphores
  - Monitors
  - Message passing
- **Scheduling types**:
  - **Batch**: e.g., Shortest Job First.
  - **Interactive**: e.g., Round Robin, Priority, Lottery, Fair-share.
  - **Real-time**: Meet deadlines, ensure predictability.
- **Policy vs Mechanism**: Separation allows better customization and control by users.
