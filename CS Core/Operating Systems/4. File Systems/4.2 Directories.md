To manage files efficiently, operating systems use **directories** (or folders), which are themselves special files storing file metadata and structure.

### 🧷 4.2.1 Single-Level Directory Systems

- Contains **only one directory** for all files.
- Common in:
  - Early personal computers
  - Simple embedded devices (e.g., cameras, music players)
  - Historical mainframes like the **CDC 6600**

#### 🟢 Pros:
- Very simple
- Fast lookup (only one location)

#### 🔴 Cons:
- No grouping of related files
- No support for multiple users or large-scale file organization

---

### 🌲 4.2.2 Hierarchical Directory Systems

- Organizes directories as a **tree** (e.g., `/`, `/home`, `/home/user/docs`)
- Allows:
  - Grouping by project, type, or user
  - Arbitrary number of subdirectories
  - Independent trees per user (e.g., `/usr/alice`, `/usr/bob`)

➡️ **First introduced by MULTICS**

### 📌 4.2.3 Path Names

#### 🔗 Path Types:
- **Absolute Path**: Full path from the root.
  - Example: `/usr/ast/mailbox` (UNIX), `\usr\ast\mailbox` (Windows)
- **Relative Path**: Path relative to the **current working directory**.

#### 🛠 Working Directory
- Each process has its **own working directory**
- Temporary and isolated
- Should be restored if changed inside a library function

#### 🔁 Special Directory Entries:
- `.` → Current directory
- `..` → Parent directory

#### Example:
If the current working directory is `/usr/ast`, then:
```bash
cp ../lib/dictionary .
```
is equivalent to:
```bash
cp /usr/lib/dictionary /usr/ast/
```

### 🧰 4.2.4 Directory Operations

#### 🗂️ Key System Calls:

| Operation     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Create`      | Make a new empty directory (adds `.` and `..`) |
| `Delete`      | Remove a directory (must be empty) |
| `Opendir`     | Open a directory to list its contents |
| `Closedir`    | Close an open directory |
| `Readdir`     | Read entries one at a time in a standard format |
| `Rename`      | Change directory name |
| `Link`        | Create a **hard link** (multiple names for same file) |
| `Unlink`      | Remove one link; file deleted only when all links are gone |

---

### 🪄 Symbolic Links (Soft Links)

- A symbolic link is a file that **points to another file's path**.
- Allows:
  - Cross-device and cross-network links
  - Indirection: follows path stored in the symlink to find the target
- **Less efficient** than hard links, but more flexible
