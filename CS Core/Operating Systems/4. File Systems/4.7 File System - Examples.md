## 📁 4.5 Example File Systems

### 🗃️ 4.5.1 MS-DOS File System

- **Legacy yet widely used** in embedded systems (USBs, cameras, MP3 players).
- **Structure:**
  - Uses a **File Allocation Table (FAT)**.
  - Three variants: **FAT-12**, **FAT-16**, **FAT-32**; address size limits partition size.
  - Directory entry format: 32 bytes (8+3 file name, attributes, timestamps, size, starting block).
  - FAT is held in memory and is a chain of block pointers.
- **Timestamps:**
  - Time: 2-byte field (±2 seconds precision).
  - Date: Limited to year 2107 → Y2108 problem.
- **Block sizes (cluster sizes)** influence partition size and efficiency.
- **FAT evolution:**
  - FAT-12: up to ~16MB.
  - FAT-16: up to 2GB partition, 8GB disk.
  - FAT-32: up to 2TB partitions with better block utilization.

### 🐧 4.5.2 UNIX V7 File System

- **Inode-based design**; hierarchical file system with hard links.
- **Directory entry**: 14-byte name + 2-byte inode number.
- **i-node structure:**
  - Holds metadata and disk block addresses.
  - Direct (10), single indirect, double indirect, triple indirect pointers.
- **Path resolution:**
  - Starts at root inode, traverses directory hierarchy step by step.
  - Special entries: `.` for current, `..` for parent.
- **Relative & absolute paths** use the same lookup logic.

## 🧪 4.6 Research on File Systems

- **Key Focus Areas:**
  - Reliability: crash tolerance, formal correctness (e.g., crash-consistent FS).
  - SSD adaptation: performance under enterprise workloads.
  - **User-space file systems (FUSE)** offer fast prototyping but slow performance.
  - Persistent memory & nonvolatile memory systems bring new challenges.
- **Efficiency Trends:**
  - Data compression tuned by access patterns.
  - Global deduplication improves storage but may degrade locality.
  - Storage usage estimation becomes complex with deduplication.

## 📚 4.7 Summary

### 🔍 Outside View:
- A file system = **files + directories** + operations (read, write, move, create, delete).
- Supports hierarchical naming.

### 🛠️ Inside View:
- Challenges:
  - Block allocation
  - Block-file mapping
  - Directory structure & metadata handling
  - Free space management (bitmap, free list)
- **Reliability**:
  - Backup: full & incremental
  - fsck-like tools to repair inconsistencies
- **Performance**:
  - **Caching**, **read-ahead**, **block placement**
  - Log-structured FS: improves small write performance
- **Examples**:
  - ISO 9660 (CD-ROMs), MS-DOS (FAT), UNIX (inode-based)
