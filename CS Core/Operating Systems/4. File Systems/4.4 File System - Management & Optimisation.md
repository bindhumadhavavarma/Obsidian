## 🗂️ 4.4.1 Disk-Space Management

### 🎯 Objective
Efficient and robust storage of files on disk, balancing performance, space utilization, and flexibility.

---

### 📦 Fixed-Size Block Allocation

#### Why Not Contiguous Allocation?
- Contiguous allocation causes fragmentation and resizing issues.
- Moving a growing file is **much slower on disk** than in memory.
- **Solution**: Split files into fixed-size blocks (typically 1–4 KB).

---

### 📏 Choosing the Right Block Size

| Block Size | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| Small (e.g., 1 KB) | Less internal fragmentation | High I/O overhead due to seeks |
| Large (e.g., 64 KB) | High throughput (fewer seeks) | More space wasted for small files |

#### ⚖️ Trade-off:
- **Space vs. Time** conflict.
- 4 KB is a **common compromise**.

#### 📊 Example:
- Disk: 1 MB per track, 8.33 ms rotation, 5 ms seek.
- 4 KB block is efficient for both:
  - Performance (reasonable data rate)
  - Storage (low wastage for 4 KB files)

### 🧮 Methods to Track Free Blocks

#### 🔗 1. **Linked List of Free Blocks**
- Each block holds pointers to other free blocks.
- E.g., 1 KB block holds 255 addresses (using 32-bit pointers).
- Good for low memory use but **high overhead** for searching free space.

#### 🧠 2. **Bitmap (Bit Vector)**
- 1 bit per block (1 = free, 0 = used or vice versa).
- **Much more compact** than linked list.
- For a 1 TB disk (~1B blocks): 
  - Bitmap size ≈ 128 KB.
  - Linked list ≈ 4 million blocks.

#### 📌 When to Use Which?
| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Disk is nearly full | Linked list may be better |
| Fragmentation common | Bitmap more flexible |
| Long runs of free blocks | Track block ranges using block + count |

---

### 🧠 Optimization: Minimize Free List Disk I/O

#### Problem:
- Frequent disk I/O when free block pointer cache is nearly empty/full.

#### Solutions:
1. **Split overflowed block** into half and keep one half in memory.
2. **Defer writes** to disk until memory cache is full.
3. **Keep the bitmap in VM**, page it in as needed.
4. **Centralize allocations** from one area to improve locality.

### 📉 Summary Table: Disk-Space Tracking Methods

| Method        | Space Efficiency | Access Speed | Scales Well | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Linked List   | Low              | Slow          | Moderate    | Good for very full disks |
| Bitmap        | High             | Fast (search) | Yes         | More flexible and space-efficient |
| Block+Count   | Compact (when contiguous) | Fast (on empty disks) | Poor with fragmentation | Best with long free runs |

## 📏 Disk Quotas

### 🎯 Purpose
To **limit user consumption** of disk space and system resources on multi-user operating systems, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

---

### 🛠️ How Quotas Are Enforced

- **System Admin** assigns:
  - Maximum number of disk **blocks** per user
  - Maximum number of **files/i-nodes** per user

---

### 📋 Open-File Table & Quota Tracking

#### When a file is opened:
- Its attributes (including **owner ID**) and disk addresses are stored in the **Open-File Table**.
- A **pointer** to the owner's **Quota Record** is added.

#### Quota Table (per user with open files):

---

### 🚦 Enforcement Logic

- Every time a **block is added**, the owner's **block count is incremented**.
- Checks made:
  - **Soft limit**: Exceeding it gives a **warning**.
  - **Hard limit**: Exceeding it causes an **error** (operation fails).
- Similar logic applies to **file count (i-nodes)**.

---

### 🧾 Quota Checks on Login

- At **login**, system checks if soft limits are exceeded.
- If exceeded:
  - User gets a **warning**.
  - **Warning count is reduced**.
- If **warnings = 0**, login is **denied** until user resolves the issue or **admin intervenes**.

---

### 🧠 Design Insight

- Users can temporarily **exceed soft limits during sessions**.
- Must **restore compliance before logout** to avoid login issues next time.
- **Hard limits** are strictly enforced **at all times**.

## 💾 4.4.2 File-System Backups

### 🎯 Purpose
Backups serve **two main purposes**:
1. **Disaster Recovery** – Recovering data after catastrophic failures (e.g., disk crashes, fire).
2. **User Error Recovery** – Restoring accidentally deleted files.

---

### 💡 General Strategies

- **Not all data should be backed up**:
  - Executables: Can be reinstalled.
  - Temp directories: Not worth saving.
  - Special files (e.g., `/dev`): Dangerous to backup.

- **Avoid redundant backup**:
  - Use **incremental dumps**: backup only files changed since last dump.
  - Can also dump only files changed since their **last individual dump**.

- **Compression Trade-off**:
  - Saves space.
  - Increases risk: A single corrupted byte can break decompression.

- **Snapshot-based backups**:
  - Take quick “frozen” snapshots.
  - Changes post-snapshot are copy-on-write to preserve backup consistency.

---

### 🛡️ Security Considerations
- Keep backup media **off-site**.
- Ensure **physical security** of tapes/disks.
- Protect backups from theft and fire damage.

---

## 📦 Physical vs Logical Dumps

### 🧱 Physical Dump
- Dumps raw disk blocks **sequentially**.
- ✅ Pros:
  - Simple and fast (at disk speed).
- ❌ Cons:
  - No selective restore.
  - Cannot skip directories.
  - No incremental backups.
  - May include **bad blocks**, unless explicitly avoided.

### 🗂️ Logical Dump
- Dumps a **directory tree** and its modified files since a given base date.
- ✅ Pros:
  - Can selectively restore files/directories.
  - Supports **incremental dumps**.
- ❌ Cons:
  - More complex, slower than physical dump.

---

### 🧠 Logical Dump Algorithm

#### 🧾 Input: Directory tree, base date

#### 🔄 Four-Phase Algorithm

1. **Phase 1** – Mark all:
   - Modified files.
   - All directories (modified or not).

2. **Phase 2** – Unmark directories **not leading to any modified file**.

3. **Phase 3** – Dump marked directories.
   - Include **attributes** (owner, permissions, timestamps).

4. **Phase 4** – Dump marked files with attributes.

📌 *See Fig. 4-28 for bitmap state through phases.*

---

### 🔁 Restoration Process

1. Create **empty filesystem**.
2. Restore latest **full dump**:
   - Directories → then files.
3. Apply **incremental dumps** in order.

---

### ⚠️ Backup Complications

- **Free block list**:
  - Not stored in dumps.
  - Must be **reconstructed** by scanning used blocks.

- **Links**:
  - File with multiple hard links should be restored only once.
  - All directories must point to the same inode.

- **Sparse (holey) files**:
  - Don’t backup holes (e.g., core dumps).
  - Restoring holes as zeros wastes space.

- **Special files**:
  - Pipes, devices, etc., should **never be backed up**.
