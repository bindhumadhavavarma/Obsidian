### 🧠 Motivation for File Systems

- **RAM limitations**: RAM is volatile and limited in size. Many applications require persistent storage that exceeds RAM capacity (e.g., databases, media storage).
- **Persistence**: Data in RAM is lost after process termination or system crashes. Persistent storage is needed to retain data across sessions and failures.
- **Concurrent access**: Multiple processes often need shared access to the same data, which isn't feasible if stored only in a single process's memory space.

### 🧱 Key Requirements for Long-Term Storage

1. Large storage capacity
2. Persistence across process termination and system failures
3. Simultaneous access by multiple processes

### 💽 Storage Mediums

- **Magnetic disks**: Traditional and still widely used.
- **Solid State Drives (SSDs)**: Faster, no moving parts, now complementing or replacing hard disks.
- **Tape/Optical disks**: Mostly used for backups due to lower performance.

Both SSDs and magnetic disks are **disk-like**, exposing a block-based interface:
- `read block k`
- `write block k`

### 📂 The File Abstraction

- Abstracts away raw block operations and presents **logical containers** for data.
- Persistent across process life cycles.
- Can be accessed concurrently by multiple processes.
- Conceptually similar to address spaces, but for disk storage instead of RAM.

Files are managed by the **file system**—the component of the OS responsible for organizing, naming, accessing, and protecting files.

---

### 🗂️ File Naming

- **File names**: Abstract identifiers used by users and programs.
- Common file systems allow alphanumeric characters, and symbols like `.`, `_`, `-`.
- Length limits vary:
  - MS-DOS: 8 characters + 3-character extension (e.g., `FILE.TXT`)
  - Modern systems: Often up to 255+ characters
- **Case sensitivity**:
  - UNIX: case-sensitive (`file`, `File`, `FILE` are different)
  - MS-DOS: case-insensitive

---

### 🧩 Extensions and File Types

- File extensions are **conventions**, not rules (in UNIX).
- In **Windows**, extensions are meaningful and registered with associated programs.
- Double-clicking opens the file using the associated program (e.g., `.docx` → MS Word).

#### 🔖 Common File Extensions

| Extension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `.c`      | C source file |
| `.o`      | Object file (compiled output) |
| `.html`   | HTML document |
| `.jpg`    | JPEG image |
| `.pdf`    | Portable Document Format |
| `.zip`    | Compressed archive |
| `.mp3`    | Audio file |
| `.ps`     | PostScript |
| `.bak`    | Backup file |

## 📁 4.1.2 File Structure

Operating systems support multiple file structures. The structure influences how data is stored, accessed, and interpreted.

### 🧱 Common File Structures

#### 1. **Unstructured Byte Sequence**
- **Used by**: UNIX, Windows
- File = Sequence of bytes (no internal structure enforced by OS)
- Interpretation left to user programs (e.g., text, images, databases)
- Maximum flexibility

#### 2. **Sequence of Fixed-Length Records**
- File = Structured as **records** (e.g., 80 or 132 bytes)
- **Read/write** operations handle one full record at a time
- Used historically in mainframe systems (e.g., punched cards, line printers)
- Now obsolete in general-purpose OS

#### 3. **Tree of Records (Keyed Access)**
- Each record has a **key field**
- Stored in a **searchable tree structure**, enabling fast key-based lookups
- The OS manages insertion and retrieval
- Used in mainframe commercial systems (e.g., indexed file systems)

## 🗃️ 4.1.3 File Types

Operating systems categorize files into different types based on usage and content.

### 🔹 Main File Types

- **Regular files**:
  - Store user data (text, images, executables, etc.)
  - Can be ASCII (text) or binary (non-text)
  
- **Directories**:
  - System files used to organize and structure files
  - Maintain mappings between file names and metadata

- **Character special files**:
  - Represent serial devices (terminals, printers)
  
- **Block special files**:
  - Represent block devices (disks)

### 🔸 ASCII vs Binary Files

| ASCII Files | Binary Files |
|-------------|--------------|
| Human-readable | Not human-readable |
| Editable via text editors | Require special programs |
| Used for text data, logs, source code | Used for executables, images, archives |

#### 📌 Advantages of ASCII:
- Easy to inspect, print, and edit
- Facilitates inter-program communication via pipelines

### 🔧 Binary File Examples

#### (a) **Executable File Format (UNIX)**
- Contains structured sections:
  - Magic number (file ID)
  - Text (code)
  - Data
  - Relocation bits
  - Symbol table (debug info)

#### (b) **Archive File Format**
- Contains multiple object modules (unlinked compiled code)
- Each preceded by a binary header with metadata (name, size, permissions)

## 🚫 File Type Enforcement Issues

Some systems strongly enforce file types via **extensions or metadata**:

- Example: `.dat` (data), `.c` (C source)
- Can **block** actions like:
  - Using `.dat` as input to compiler expecting `.c`
  - Renaming `.dat` → `.c` without system objection
- Adds "user-friendliness" but can frustrate advanced users who require flexibility

### 🛠️ File Type Detection Tools

- **UNIX `file` utility**:
  - Inspects file content heuristically
  - Classifies files as text, executable, directory, etc.

## 📂 4.1.4 File Access

### 🧵 Sequential Access
- Early systems allowed only sequential file access: data could only be read in order, from start to end.
- Suitable for magnetic tape storage.
- Files could be **rewound** for re-reading.

### 🔀 Random Access
- Enabled by disk storage: allows reading/writing at arbitrary positions.
- Essential for applications like databases or airline reservations.

### 🔧 Access Modes
- **Direct read with offset**: Read ops specify starting position.
- **Seek-based** (used in UNIX/Windows): A `seek` operation sets the current pointer, followed by reads/writes from that position.

---

## 🏷️ 4.1.5 File Attributes (Metadata)

### 📋 Common Attributes (Fig. 4-5)

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Protection | Access control information |
| Password | Required password (in some systems) |
| Creator / Owner | IDs of creator and owner |
| Flags | Read-only, hidden, system, archive, ASCII/binary, random access, temporary, lock |
| Record Metadata | Length, key position, key length |
| Timestamps | Creation, last access, last modification |
| Size Info | Current file size, max size (for preallocation in old systems) |

- **Archive flag**: Set on changes, cleared on backup.
- **Temporary flag**: Deletes file when process ends.
- **Timestamps**: Used for recompilation decisions (e.g., `make`).

---

## ⚙️ 4.1.6 File Operations

### 🧰 Common System Calls

1. **Create**: Declare file creation, set initial attributes.
2. **Delete**: Remove file and free space.
3. **Open / Close**: Access control, resource allocation, flush last blocks on close.
4. **Read / Write**: Data transfer from/to current file position.
5. **Append**: Write only to the end of the file.
6. **Seek**: Set the file pointer for random access.
7. **Get / Set Attributes**: Inspect or modify file metadata (e.g., `chmod`, `stat`).
8. **Rename**: Logical renaming without copying.

## 📎 4.1.7 Example: UNIX File Copy Program

### 🧪 Program Summary (Fig. 4-6)
- Copies one file to another using low-level system calls.
- Called as: `copyfile abc xyz`
- Reads in 4KB chunks using a buffer.

### 📌 Key Components

- **File descriptors**: Returned by `open()` and `creat()`.
- **System calls** used:
  - `open()` – Open source file
  - `creat()` – Create destination file
  - `read()` – Read into buffer
  - `write()` – Write buffer to output
  - `close()` – Finalize file operations
- **Error handling**: Minimal – exit codes indicate error type.
- **Buffer Size**: 4096 bytes, defined via macro `BUF_SIZE`.

```c
in_fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
out_fd = creat(argv[2], OUTPUT_MODE);
rd_count = read(in_fd, buffer, BUF_SIZE);
wt_count = write(out_fd, buffer, rd_count);
```

- Loop continues until `read()` returns 0 (EOF).
- Ensures only `rd_count` bytes are written (last chunk may be smaller than 4KB).
- Closes both files and exits with appropriate code.
