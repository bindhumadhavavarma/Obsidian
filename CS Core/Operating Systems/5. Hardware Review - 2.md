### Buses

As processors and memory became faster, traditional bus architectures like the **IBM PC bus** struggled to handle increasing traffic, prompting the development of additional and more efficient buses.
#### PCIe Bus

- **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express):** Developed by Intel in 2004 as a successor to PCI and ISA buses.
- **Features:**
    - **Serial architecture:** Data is transmitted bit-by-bit through a single connection (lane), similar to network packets.
    - **Dedicated connections:** Unlike shared parallel buses, PCIe provides point-to-point connections, eliminating the need for an arbiter.
    - Capable of transferring **tens of gigabits per second**, far outpacing its predecessors.

#### USB (Universal Serial Bus)

- Initially invented for slow I/O devices like keyboards and mice, **USB** has evolved significantly:
    - USB 1.0: 12 Mbps
    - USB 2.0: 480 Mbps
    - USB 3.0: 5 Gbps
    - USB 3.2: 20 Gbps
    - USB 4: 40 Gbps
- **Centralized architecture:** A root device polls connected devices every 1 ms for activity.
- **Hot-pluggable:** Devices can be connected and used immediately without requiring a system reboot, unlike older architectures.
- USB also powers devices and uses connectors with 4â€“11 wires, depending on the version.

#### Bus System Overview

- The CPU connects to:
    - **Memory:** Via a fast DDR4 bus.
    - **Graphics devices:** Via PCIe.
    - **Other devices:** Through a hub connected to various buses like USB (for peripherals), SATA (for hard disks and DVD drives), and PCIe (for Ethernet).

### Booting the Computer

The boot process begins when the power button is pressed and involves initializing hardware and loading the operating system.

#### BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

- Found on older systems, BIOS:
    - Resides in a small flash memory chip on the motherboard.
    - Initializes devices and sets up runtime firmware.
    - Determines the boot device using a list stored in CMOS memory.
    - Loads the **Master Boot Record (MBR):**
        - The MBR contains a program to identify the active partition, load a secondary bootloader, and begin OS execution.

#### Limitations of BIOS:

- Supports only smaller storage sizes (up to 2 TB).
- Architecture-dependent.
- Slower booting.

#### UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)

- A modern replacement for BIOS that addresses its limitations:
    - Supports storage sizes up to **8 ZiB** and faster booting.
    - Can handle multiple architectures and file systems (e.g., FAT12, FAT16, FAT32).
    - Operates like a small OS, capable of reading partitions, file systems, and executables.
    - Includes a shell with standard commands for configuration.

#### UEFI Boot Process:

1. Searches for the **GUID Partition Table (GPT)** in the second sector, which holds partition details.
2. Reads bootloaders in **PE (Portable Executable)** format directly from the file system.
3. Uses the **UEFI Boot Manager** to present a menu of operating systems or partitions to boot from, with configurable priorities.
4. Loads the selected bootloader, which initializes and starts the operating system.
