Why is vision so difficult ?
Because inpart its an inverse problem. we are trying to recover some unknowns given insufficient information to fully specify the solution. We must therefore resort to physics-based and probabilistic models, or machine learning from large sets of examples, to disambiguate between potential solutions.
