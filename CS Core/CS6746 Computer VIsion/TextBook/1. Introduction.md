Why is vision so difficult ?
Because inpart its an inverse problem. we are trying to recover some unknowns given insufficient information to fully specify the solution. We must therefore resort to physics-based and probabilistic models, or machine learning from large sets of examples, to disambiguate between potential solutions.

we say its an inverse problem because when taking a picture or video we are project a 3d world into 2d and to understand the 3d heuristics from a 2d image we have to somehow calculate the lost 3rd dimenstion.
