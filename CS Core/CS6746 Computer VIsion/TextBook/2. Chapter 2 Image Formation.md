## 1. Rotation + Translation = Rigid Body Motion

Equation in the book:

$$
x' = R x + t
$$

* $x$ = original point
* $x'$ = transformed point
* $R$ = rotation matrix
* $t$ = translation vector

👉 Meaning:

1. Rotate the point using $R$.
2. Then shift it using $t$.

This is called **rigid body motion** (or Euclidean transformation) because:

* Distances between points don’t change.
* Angles don’t change.
* Shapes are preserved, just rotated & moved.

---

## 2. The Rotation Matrix

The standard 2D rotation matrix is

$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* Rotates points counterclockwise by angle $\theta$.
* Properties:

  * $R R^T = I$ → rows/columns are orthonormal (unit length & perpendicular).
  * $|R| = 1$ → determinant is 1 (no stretching or flipping).

---

## 3. Homogeneous Matrix Form

Using homogeneous coordinates, this becomes:

$$
\bar{x}' =
\begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0^T & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\bar{x}
$$

So in one matrix multiplication, you apply both rotation and translation.

---

## 4. Adding Scaling → Similarity Transform

Now suppose we also want scaling (zoom in/out).

Equation:

$$
x' = s R x + t
$$

* $s$ = scale factor.
* $R$ = rotation.
* $t$ = translation.

So you: **scale → rotate → translate**.

Matrix form:

$$
\bar{x}' =
\begin{bmatrix}
sR & t \\
0^T & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\bar{x}
$$

---

## 5. The Alternate Form with $a, b$

The book writes:

$$
\bar{x}' =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b & t_x \\
b & a & t_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\bar{x}
$$

where $a = s\cos\theta, \; b = s\sin\theta$.

* For pure rotation (no scaling), we’d require $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.
* With scaling, that condition is relaxed.

👉 So you can encode both rotation and scaling in just two numbers $a, b$.

---

## 6. What is Preserved?

* **Rigid body motion (R + t):** preserves distances, preserves angles.
* **Similarity transform (sR + t):** preserves angles, but not distances (things get bigger/smaller).

---

✅ **Plain summary:**

* Rigid body motion = rotate + translate. Distances & angles stay the same.
* Similarity transform = scale + rotate + translate. Angles stay the same, distances change.

## 1. Points vs. Lines (Vectors vs. Co-vectors)

* Up to now, we’ve been transforming **points**.

  * Example: rotate or translate a pixel’s coordinates.
  * This uses a matrix like $x' = Hx$.

* But what if we want to transform a **line equation** instead of the points on it?

  * A 2D line in homogeneous form is:

    $$
    \tilde{l} \cdot \tilde{x} = 0
    $$

    where $\tilde{l} = (a,b,c)$ and $\tilde{x} = (x,y,1)$.

Here, $\tilde{l}$ is not a point but the **parameters that define a line**.
This is what they mean by a **co-vector**.

---

## 2. What Happens When You Transform a Point?

If the transformation matrix is $H$, then a point transforms as:

$$
\tilde{x}' = H \tilde{x}
$$

So far so good.

---

## 3. But What About Lines?

We want the line equation to “stay true” even after transformation:

$$
\tilde{l}' \cdot \tilde{x}' = 0
$$

Substitute $\tilde{x}' = H \tilde{x}$:

$$
\tilde{l}'^T (H \tilde{x}) = 0
$$

Rewrite it as:

$$
(H^T \tilde{l}')^T \tilde{x} = 0
$$

Compare with the original line equation $\tilde{l}^T \tilde{x} = 0$.
For these to match, we must have:

$$
\tilde{l} = H^T \tilde{l}'
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\tilde{l}' = H^{-T} \tilde{l}
$$

---

## 4. Intuition (Why Transposed Inverse?)

* For **points**, you apply the transformation $H$.
* For **lines** (or normals, or planes), you apply the **inverse transpose** $H^{-T}$.

👉 Why? Because a line is defined by all the points that satisfy the equation.
If the points move by $H$, the equation coefficients must “compensate” so the condition still holds. That compensation is exactly $H^{-T}$.

---

## 5. Where Else This Shows Up

This “inverse transpose” rule pops up in many places in graphics & vision:

* Transforming **normals** in 3D rendering.
* Converting between spaces in ray tracing.
* Maintaining consistent line/plane equations after perspective transforms.

---

✅ **Plain summary:**

* Points transform by $H$.
* Lines/normals (co-vectors) transform by $H^{-T}$.
* Co-vectors = things that define *constraints* (like “all points on this line satisfy equation”), not actual positions.

### **Homogeneous Coordinates & Perspective Projection**

#### **Homogeneous Coordinates Overview**

* **Homogeneous Coordinates** extend traditional 3D coordinates $(x, y, z)$ to 4D coordinates $(x, y, z, w)$.
* This extension helps represent transformations and projections more generally and conveniently.
* $w$ is a **scaling factor** and plays a key role in perspective transformations.
* **Finite points** in homogeneous coordinates typically have $w = 1$.
* Points at **infinity** (e.g., parallel lines in perspective) have $w = 0$.

#### **Why Use Homogeneous Coordinates?**

* **Unified representation**: Allows easy handling of both finite points and points at infinity.
* **Projective transformations**: Essential for operations like perspective projection, where the result is dependent on the depth of the point.
* **Camera transformations**: Homogeneous coordinates allow for easy modeling of camera positioning, rotations, translations, and scaling in 3D space.

#### **Perspective Projection and the Role of $w$**

* **Perspective projection** is a common method of transforming 3D coordinates into 2D by accounting for depth.

  The formula in **homogeneous coordinates** is:

  $$
  \tilde{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ w' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{x}{w} \\ \frac{y}{w} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
  $$

* **How the projection works**:

  * The 3D point $(x, y, z, w)$ is transformed by the **projection matrix**.
  * The new 2D coordinates $(x', y')$ are given by dividing the original $x$ and $y$ by the $w$-coordinate.
  * This division mimics the **depth effect**: points farther away (larger $w$) appear smaller in the 2D projection.

#### **Intuition Behind $w$**

* **$w = 1$**: Represents a finite point. No scaling effect.
* **$w > 1$**: The point is farther away, so its projected size decreases (perspective effect).
* **$w < 1$**: The point is closer, and its projected size increases.
* **$w = 0$**: Represents points at infinity (like parallel lines), which maintain constant size.

#### **Why Not Just Use $z$ for Depth?**

* **Homogeneous coordinates** allow more **general transformations** (e.g., translations and rotations), which can't be achieved by using just $z$.
* $w$ allows us to handle **projective transformations** that depend on the position of the point and the camera.
* Dividing by $w$ allows **scaling** based on depth, which directly influences the **perspective effect** in 2D.

#### **Practical Uses of Homogeneous Coordinates**

* Used in **3D rendering** and **computer vision** to handle transformations, camera projections, and visual effects.
* **Perspective projection** uses homogeneous coordinates to scale 3D points based on their depth.
* In **3D graphics**, transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) are often represented using 4x4 matrices to work with homogeneous coordinates.

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Homogeneous coordinates** represent points in 4D, allowing for more flexible transformations.
2. **$w$** is the key factor in perspective projection, affecting how depth influences the 2D projection of a 3D point.
3. **Perspective projection** divides the 3D point’s $x$ and $y$ by $w$ to simulate how objects appear smaller as they move farther away from the camera.
4. **Dividing by $w$** ensures that the resulting image reflects realistic depth effects (perspective), which is crucial for computer graphics and vision tasks.
