we talked about how pinhole cameras work

focal length, center of the camera, image plane, virtual image, pinhole.

accidental cameras where windows act as a pinhole and project outside world inside a dark room

when we take a picture -> from 3d to 2d we loose lot of details like size and angles.

vanishing points : where parallel lines in real life, seem to converge in a picture.

given x,y,z how do we calculate u' and v', that is the coordinates of the image. (formulas in ppt)

a lot of math that i have to understand .............. and after that

we talked about box filter and how to apply it, what it does? we observed that it blurs out the image.

what is aliasing? (doubt)
