There are 4 standard versions of c, c89/90, c99, c11. the numbers denote the year it was released. 


### Preprocessor commands

they are identified by the # sign. these are things that tell the compiler to do something before it compiles the code. examples are #define, #include, #ifdef, #endif, #else.
They can be anywhere in the code but are mostly mentioned at the top of the file.

### Header files and Libraries

Header files are the .h files. They define information about functions that are provided by the file.

if we say #include <stdio.h> then the angle brackets make the compiler to look for the file in standard system directories. 
If we have to include a user defined header file then we use the double quotes instead of the angle brackets. eg. #include"myheader.h"

Header files include many different things like
- #define directives
- structure declarations
- typedef statements
- function prototypes

### Variables and Data Types

- It generally takes 4 bytes of memory.
#### Float
- decimal places numbers
- 
#### Enum
- enum primaryColor {red, yellow, blue};
- enum primaryColor mycolor = red;


#### Format specifier

%i - integer
%f - float
%e double
%g double
%c char
%s string
