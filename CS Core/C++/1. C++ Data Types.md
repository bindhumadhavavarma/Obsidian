Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. In C++, data types are categorized into three main groups:

---

### 📦 1. **Primitive (Built-in) Data Types**

These are fundamental data types provided by the language:

#### 🔢 Integral Types
- **`int`** – Represents integer values.
  - Size: Typically **4 bytes** on most systems (but can be 2 bytes on older systems or microcontrollers).
  - Range (for 2 bytes): `-32,768 to 32,767` (signed)
  - Range (for 4 bytes): `-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647` (signed)
- **`char`** – Represents a single character.
  - Size: **1 byte (8 bits)**
  - ASCII values range from `-128 to 127` (signed) or `0 to 255` (unsigned)
  - Used for storing characters like `'A'`, `'9'`, etc.

#### 🧮 Floating-Point Types
- **`float`**
  - Size: **4 bytes**
  - Precision: ~6–7 decimal digits
- **`double`**
  - Size: **8 bytes**
  - Precision: ~15 decimal digits
- **`long double`**
  - Size: Typically **10 or 12 bytes** (platform-dependent, sometimes 16 bytes)

#### ✅ Boolean Type
- **`bool`**
  - Represents logical values: `true` or `false`
  - Typically uses **1 byte**, but only 1 bit is necessary. Size may vary based on compiler.
  
**🔍 Note:** Memory sizes depend on the compiler and platform (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems).

---

### 🧰 2. **User-Defined Data Types**

These allow the programmer to create custom types for better data structuring:

- **`enum`** – Enumeration of named integer constants.
- **`struct`** – Grouping of variables of different types under one name (default public access).
- **`union`** – Like struct, but shares memory for all members (only one member used at a time).
- **`class`** – Like struct, but with default private access and added support for methods and object-oriented programming.

---

### 🧱 3. **Derived Data Types**

Built from primitive or user-defined types:

- **Array** – Collection of elements of the same type.
- **Pointer** – Stores the memory address of another variable.
- **Reference** – An alias for another variable.

## 🛠️ Modifiers

Modifiers alter the meaning/size of the data types:
### ➕ Unsigned
- Removes the sign bit, making all values non-negative.
- **`unsigned int`**: 0 to 65535 (for 2 bytes)
- **`unsigned char`**: 0 to 255

### 🔁 Long / Short
- Used to increase or decrease storage size.

| Modifier        | Example           | Size             |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `short int`     | `short`           | 2 bytes          |
| `long int`      | `long`            | 4 or 8 bytes     |
| `long long int` | `long long`       | 8 bytes (C++11+) |
| `long double`   |                   | 10+ bytes        |

**⚠️ Note**: `sizeof()` in C++ can be used to check actual size on your system.

## 📏 Bit-Level Insight (for range understanding)

- A signed `n`-bit type uses 1 bit for the sign.
- Remaining `n-1` bits represent the magnitude:
  - Max value = \(2^{n-1} - 1\)
  - Min value = \(-2^{n-1}\)

**Example**: 
- 16-bit signed int:
  - 1 sign bit + 15 bits for value
  - Range = `-32768 to 32767`

---

## 🧠 Interview/Practical Tips

- Use `sizeof()` to confirm data type sizes at runtime.
- `char` can be used for both character representation and small integer storage.
- Always prefer `int32_t`, `uint64_t`, etc. from `<cstdint>` for fixed-width integers.
- Floating-point comparison should use tolerance (`epsilon`) due to precision loss.
- Use `bool` in conditions, never rely on integers for truthiness unless absolutely needed.
